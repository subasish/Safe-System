AB  - U.S. cities and States are adopting the Safe System Approach to address inequities in transportation, protect vulnerable road users, and set safer speed limits. This article presents examples of how two states--Washington and California--and two cities--Philadelphia and  Portland, Oregon--have committed to the goal of zero deaths by employing the Safe System Approach to address safety for all road users. These states and cities are institutionalizing the approach and using it as a foundation for the policies that affect their operations at both program and project levels.

TI  - NHTSA’s Safe System Approach: Educating and Protecting All Road Users
PY  - 2022
VL  - 85
IS  - 4
AB  - This article presents an overview of the US National Highway Traffic Administration's work to educate and protect all road users by implementing a Safe System Approach. The Safe System Approach is a data-driven, holistic, and equitable method to roadway safety that fully integrates the needs of all users, anticipates the possibility of errors by drivers and other road users, and manages crash impact forces to levels tolerated by the human body. The Safe System Approach includes five elements: safe road users, safe vehicles, safe speeds, safe roads, and post-crash care. The approach incorporates the 5 Es of traffic safety—equity, engineering, education, enforcement, and emergency medical services (EMS)—but goes beyond the traditional approach to enlist designers, operators, and users of the transportation system to prevent fatal crashes and reduce crash severity. NHTSA’s efforts focus on safe road users, safe vehicles, safe speeds, and post-crash care.

AB  - Crashes at intersections contribute significantly to traffic fatalities and serious injuries in the United States. This article describes how the US Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is  applying the Safe System Approach to intersections to improve roadway safety at these critical junctions. FHWA has developed a Safe System for Intersections (SSI) framework and methodology, which represents a first step toward the development of objective and implementable analyses that reflect key Safe System concepts. The Safe System assessment of an intersection can serve as an additional metric to inform alternatives analysis and identify an optimal solution for an intersection.

AB  - Achieving the vision of eliminating deaths and serious injuries from the Nation’s roads may seem daunting with traffic fatalities in the United States stubbornly remaining between 32,000 and 39,000 annually for more than a decade. To make meaningful progress, changes are needed in how to think about the traffic safety problem and the approaches to solve the problem. The Safe System Approach is being applied with great success in a growing number of nations and cities around the world and has now taken hold in the United States. This article discusses the Safe System Approach's origins and six foundational principles.

AB  - The Governors Highway Safety Association (GHSA) selected Cambridge Systematics, Inc. (CS) to produce a report providing guidance on how State Highway Safety Offices (SHSOs) and their partners can conduct highway safety planning and implement behavioral safety countermeasures and programs within the Safe System framework, while also supporting local Safe System and Vision Zero programs. In addition to a literature review of successful U.S. and international Safe System practices, CS met with 21 experts representing SHSOs, law enforcement, transportation safety organizations, universities, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to better understand how they view behavioral safety programs through the Safe System lens. This report reflects what was learned about the SHSOs’ role in implementing the Safe System approach and what is needed to change the culture in a state, so that safety is factored into every transportation decision at the organizational and personal level. It also addresses implementing behavioral safety in an equitable manner in the context of a Safe System. Direct comments from expert panel members are included throughout the report, along with resources they identified as being helpful to SHSOs.

TI  - Defining suitable Safe System projects: The experience of the SaferAfrica project in five African countries
PY  - 2021/12
VL  - 45
IS  - 4
SP  - pp 594-601
AB  - When dealing with road safety in Africa, one should bear in mind that road safety problems need to be seen in their context as the solutions proposed to address them. While it is relevant to consider international good practices, African stakeholders should become owners of the interventions addressing their problems and take the responsibility for developing and implementing the appropriate solutions, taking advantage of suitable technical assistance, if needed. Based on these considerations, in this paper, a presentation is made of the process used in the European research project SaferAfrica to define suitable Safe System projects in Africa. This project aims at supporting policymakers and stakeholders with evidence on critical risk factors, related actions, and good practices drawn from high-quality data and knowledge. In the project, road safety and traffic management capacity reviews at the country level were carried out in five countries (Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Tunisia, Kenya, and South Africa), following the World Bank guidelines. After conducting such a capacity review, these guidelines recommend the preparation and implementation of Safe System projects, “stand-alone, multisector initiatives targeting high-risk corridors and areas, with outcomes large enough to be reliably measured.” In SaferAfrica, this approach aims at facilitating the implementation of Safe System projects in the considered countries, by identifying detailed short-term improvement plans and producing contextualized terms of reference for some interventions per selected country. These interventions are remedial, they address high-priority concerns and demonstrate the viability of high potential gains within current administrative and legislative frameworks. To design interventions suitable to the existing context, the transferability audit tool was adopted within a “participative” process, involving all possible interested parties, from the institutions to NGOs. Results from the process are presented and discussed.

AB  - The Center for Injury Research and Policy at Johns Hopkins University (JHCIRP), known for its leadership in the public health arena, in collaboration with the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), recognized for its leadership in the practice of transportation planning and transportation engineering, recently convened the Safe System Consortium, with support from the FIA Foundation. This consortium included a diverse group of experts including transportation planners and engineers, public health professionals, safety advocates, academics, researchers, and international road safety experts. The purpose of this effort was to develop recommendations directed primarily at Congress and the Biden administration that can move the United States toward Vision Zero using the Safe System Approach while supporting a more equitable transportation system. Through a series of meetings, the Consortium members identified three essential areas for change: safety across the system, equity by investment, and progress by design. This article outlines the rationale behind this effort and presents the recommendations.

TI  - Primer on Safe System Approach for Pedestrians and Bicyclists
PY  - 2021/05
SP  - 29p
AB  - Historically, crashes have been viewed as the result of an error on the part of the individual roadway user—a law or rule was broken, a wrong decision made. The Safe System approach acknowledges that humans make mistakes and, importantly, are vulnerable to the forces that occur during a crash. By focusing on eliminating fatal and serious injuries the Safe System approach inherently places a priority on pedestrians and bicyclists, who are at a higher risk of fatal or serious injury than a person driving or traveling in a motor vehicle. The purpose of this primer is to provide transportation agencies a baseline understanding of the Safe System approach and how it relates to bicycle and pedestrian safety.

SP  - 159p
AB  - This report presents a Safe System for Intersections (SSI) method that intersection planners and designers can readily implement, that dovetails with the typical U.S. project development process, and that uses commonly available project-level data. The SSI method is presented in the context of a Stage 1 Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE), at the scoping phase of project development where intersection alternatives are analyzed with respect to whether they meet project needs and are practical to pursue. The method incorporates concepts of conflict point identification and classification, exposure, kinetic energy transfer, conflict point severity, and intersection movement complexity. Application of the SSI method results in multiple measures of effectiveness (MOEs) and a set of SSI scores that characterize the extent to which an intersection alternative in a given context aligns with the principles of kinetic energy management and a Safe System. The SSI MOEs and SSI scores can serve as additional safety metrics to inform the process of screening alternatives and identifying an optimal solution for an intersection. The report includes an overview of Safe System concepts and principles, a detailed description of the SSI method, example project applications, and a future vision for the method.

TI  - Safe System in road safety public policy: A case study from Victoria, Australia
PY  - 2021
AB  - Safe System has been the dominant approach to road safety in Victoria for over fifteen years, guiding the development and implementation of policy. Limited attention has been paid to the development and application of Safe System in a public policy setting. The aims of this research were to describe the intentions of Safe System in Victoria, and analyse how well this aligns with models of successful public policy. Using a qualitative approach, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with Australian and international experts (n = 10). These experts represented a range of organisations and leadership levels that were either directly involved in the development or had a detailed understanding of the development of Safe System in Victoria. The interview results were analysed using a policy success model. The findings suggested that Safe System can provide a framework to address road safety in Victoria, however successful public policy needs to ensure that the development of policy addresses the identified problem and that the results are maintained for some time. Safe System meets some of these requirements, but principally lacks explanation for how its overarching approach is meant to be understood and utilised. Practically, road safety professionals need to clarify the purpose of the Safe System concept in order for it to be successfully integrated into public policy. Whilst Safe System requires additional clarification, it has garnered additional interest and debate in road safety and from this perspective has advanced public policy.

AB  - The purpose of this report is to explore the relationship between the Safe System approach and the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP). This report focuses on the two major components of the HSIP: the States’ Strategic Highway Safety Plan (SHSP) and the program of highway safety improvement projects (or States’ HSIP), as well as foundational elements of the HSIP that influence both program areas. The report first defines the principles and core elements of the Safe System approach. The report then examines foundational elements of the HSIP, State SHSP, and State HSIP as compared to the Safe System principles and presents areas of alignment, as well as opportunities and noteworthy practices. The report concludes with a discussion of next steps for Federal and State safety stakeholders to advance implementation of the Safe System approach through these existing safety programs. The primary target audience for this report is Federal and State safety stakeholders involved in the State SHSP and HSIP. The report may also benefit other safety stakeholders that have a vested interest in these existing safety programs or administer similar efforts at the regional or local level (e.g., State safety program, local road safety plans).

AB  - This report summarises activities undertaken to produce guidance on road cross-section design for road stereotypes during stage 1 and 2 of this project. The guidance enables road managers, planners and designers to achieve improved safety outcomes by applying consistent standards along a road corridor. Thirteen road stereotypes were identified covering rural and urban roads ranging from freeways/motorways to local access roads. For each stereotype, a range of cross-sections was developed with appropriate attributes. Each cross-section was assessed for crash risk using the International Road Assessment Program (iRAP) and the Australian National Risk Assessment Model (ANRAM). The tables provide guidance on the expected safety performance, or crash risk, of appropriate cross-section options for each stereotype. Note that the range of attribute dimensions in the assessment was very limited, so assessment results should be considered as an indication of the safety benefits for the nominated attributes. This information can be used to develop safety improvement plans on a network/corridor, to reduce crash risk on the network. Network/corridor plans can then inform project scoping decisions.

AB  - The Guide to Traffic Management has 13 parts and provides comprehensive coverage of traffic management guidance for practitioners involved in traffic engineering, road design, town planning and road safety. Part 13: Safe System Approach to Transport Management is concerned with traffic management practice under the Safe System philosophy. The Guide emphasises the need for the road system to provide an environment which assists road users to behave effectively and safely. It considers the role of traffic management in influencing road user behaviour, and provides guidance for practitioners specifically on road safety aspects of traffic management. Part 13 defines a safe road environment and the broad approaches for achieving it. It outlines basic human factors as related to users of the road and traffic environment, and how these can be influenced by road design and traffic management practice. It also describes the basic components of road safety engineering and its application in terms of risk engineering concepts, primary strategies and safety management systems, and outlines the principles and practice of managing safety in the road environment, as related to road infrastructure features and the basic tools of traffic engineering and management.

AB  - The Movement and Place Framework is increasingly used to guide transport planning in delivering a more integrated transport system to improve customer outcomes and support a range of user groups. Work is already underway in some jurisdictions to integrate Safe System principles and treatments within the Movement and Place Framework to safely cater for all road users and enable more proactive and lasting road safety benefits. This is particularly important for the liveability of places and vibrant streets, where greater numbers of pedestrians and cyclists gather. They are inherently more vulnerable in crashes and, in some environments, highly exposed to the risk of crashes. This project has developed guidance for Australasian jurisdictions in ensuring, or transitioning to, safe use of roads and streets by pedestrians and cyclists. Road designers and system operators are encouraged to apply the guidance when designing new or redesigning existing roads and streets, and when making decisions about how these roads and streets will operate. The integration of Safe System aligned road elements for walking and cycling into the Movement and Place Framework aims to eventually eliminate deaths and serious injuries to pedestrians and cyclists on Australasian roads.

AB  - This report provides the outcomes of a Safe System review of the Austroads Guide to Traffic Management (AGTM). The AGTM is a series of documents providing guidance for practitioners involved in traffic engineering, road design and road safety, and addresses treatment selection, such as intersection treatments, therefore plays an important role in influencing treatments used on road networks. Strengthening the guidance relating to treatments and their likely effectiveness in alignment with the Safe System philosophy presents an opportunity to integrate Safe System into traffic engineering and management activities. The report demonstrates where there is an opportunity to further embed Safe System into the AGTM series based on recent research and presents new and revised content to address many of the safe system gaps in the AGTM to strengthen the guidance relating to treatments and their likely effectiveness in aligning with Safe System philosophy.

TI  - Developing Safe System Projects in Africa
PY  - 2019
SP  - 16p
AB  - When dealing with road safety in Africa, one should bear in mind that road safety problems in Africa must be seen in their own context as the solutions proposed to address them. While it is relevant to take into account international good practices, African stakeholders should become owners of the interventions addressing their problems and take the responsibility for developing and implementing the appropriate solutions, taking advantage of suitable technical assistance, if needed. Based on these considerations, in this paper a presentation is made of the process used in the European research project "SaferAfrica - Innovating dialogue and problems appraisal for a safer Africa" to develop Safe System road safety intervention proposals for Africa. SaferAfrica aims at supporting policy makers and stakeholders with evidence on critical risk factors, related actions and good practices drawn from high quality data and knowledge. This project also serves as a platform to foster effective cooperation in road safety and to propose possible next road safety steps and identify possible funding sources in those countries were capacity review is carried out. In the project, road safety and traffic management capacity reviews at the country level were carried out in four countries (Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Tunisia and Kenya), following the World Bank guidelines. After conducting such a capacity review, these guidelines recommend the preparation and implementation of Safe System projects, “stand-alone, multisector initiatives targeting high-risk corridors and areas, with outcomes large enough to be reliably measured.” In SaferAfrica, this approach aims at facilitating the implementation of Safe System projects in the considered countries, by identifying detailed short-term improvement plans, and producing contextualized Terms of Reference for a number of interventions per selected country. These interventions are remedial in nature, they address high-priority concerns and demonstrate the viability of high potential gains within current administrative and legislative frameworks. In order to design interventions suitable to the existing context, a transferability assessment tool is adopted within a “participative” process, involving all possible interested parties, from the institutions to NGOs. The tool will indicate which immediate enabling actions are required to overcome legislative, regulatory, organisational, institutional and other barriers that may prevent measures or actions from being implemented. Results from the process are presented and discussed.

TI  - Actions and Results of Mexico Aimed at Achieving the Objectives of the Safe System Approach
PY  - 2019
SP  - 14p
AB  - Mexico joined the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020 through the establishment of actions aimed at strengthening the five pillars proposed by the UN, which were embodied in the National Road Safety Strategy 2011-2020. From the middle of the Decade, it was observed that the global trends of reduction of deaths and severe injuries due to road accidents were not enough to meet the objectives of the Decade, making it necessary to implement more effective approaches and management systems to close the existing gap. Within the implementation of such approaches, various activities have been developed, ranging from specific initiatives to multi-institutional efforts. Specific initiatives include the implementation of new laws that regulate the minimum safety features that new vehicles and motorcycle helmets must meet, as well as the development of a Road Safety Audit Manual that will serve as a guide for the evaluation of the safety provided by the road infrastructure. Within the multi-institutional sphere, it is worth highlighting the efforts that have been made in the area of road safety management, implementing integration protocols and interinstitutional collaboration for the generation of the comprehensive database of road accidents, as well as the development of a system of indicators to track the evolution of road accidents and evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures and programs. These efforts have had favorable results in the country's road safety, reporting in the last five years a decrease in the number of accidents; likewise, there is a decrease in the number of total victims resulting from road accidents, reporting less injured each year and stabilizing the number of deaths. This paper describes the previous aspects, as well as the main actions undertaken and the results obtained. Proposals are established for the strategy of the next decade, including awareness programs for all road users and integrate new concepts on human factor in the design of infrastructure, seeking to forgive human errors that may arise, among other important points such as the reduction of arrival times of pre-hospital medical attention and the adequate follow-up of the victims.

SN  - 9782840605850
PY  - 2019
SP  - 89p
AB  - This report provides a contribution to global road safety through a summary of National Safe System Policies and Implementation in relation to the Safe System approach. The report also highlights the steps that low, middle and high-income countries alike can take to accelerate progress towards Safe  System outcomes. The report includes a number of key findings from a review and survey of international practice related to national Safe System policies and implementation, which are listed below and expanded further in the body of the report. The focus of this report is related to infrastructure road safety elements, with limited focus on the institutional arrangements and management of safety. It should be understood that successful Safe System approach involves more than infrastructure actions, recognizing the need for a hositic approach that encompasses education, enforcement, management and institutional procedures in support of collision reduction and prevention. There are some major challenges and significant barriers that road agencies still face when attempting to implement Safe System policies. Policy challenges include support and funding, guidance and information. Management challenges included coordination and availability of skilled staff, lack of crash data and knowledge of the road state/condition. It is encouraging that knowledge regarding the Safe System is relatively high, and many countries have now adopted this approach. However, only a third of respondents to this survey indicated that their countries had successfully implemented a Safe System approach. In regards to Safe System infrastructure, only half of the surveyed countries reported that they had successfully implemented specific targets at national level, while others indicated that such targets were embedded in other strategic plans. The vast majority of countries have set road safety targets, although in many cases (around half of these surveyed) there were no specific targets relating to the provision of safe road infrastructure. The use of targeted Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) to assist in setting ambitious road safety targets and track progress towards these is increasingly recognised as an important element of managing road safety, including KPIs for infrastructure. Further advice is required for road agencies regarding effective infrastructure KPI’s with examples provided within this report providing a useful starting point. Most countries have methods to prioritise road safety investments, and similarly, most use multiple methods. The most commonly used approach is Benefit-Cost Ratio, but Potential for Improvement, Cost Effectiveness and Crash Rates are also commonly used. The results from this survey represent current activity in a wide variety of countries, including those in LMICs and HICs. All countries are encouraged to benchmark their own road safety activity against the actions undertaken by those contributing to this survey. All countries stand to gain some improved knowledge by assessing the policies and activities that will lead them to greater Safe System

TI  - Transitions within a safe road system
PY  - 2018/12
VL  - 121
SP  - pp 250-257
AB  - As drivers move through the road transport system they are exposed to a range of different situations and road conditions in a relatively short space of time. Drivers’ expectations about what will happen on different types of roads have strong effects on their speed choices, and where they look and what they attend to. As a result it is important to assist drivers to change their expectations when they transition from one road type to another. In this experiment the authors investigated the effectiveness of different centreline road markings in preparing for a horizontal curve as drivers moved from a motorway to a two-lane rural country road. Fifty individuals were recruited to participate in a video-based simulated driving task to compare three centreline marking types in terms of their effects on speed choice and reactions to a driving hazard (horizontal curve). Although a complex marking previously associated with high risk produced the largest speed reductions during the transition from the motorway, it was the centreline more traditionally associated with rural country roads (dashed white centreline) that was associated with the best hazard reactions post-transition (brake reaction time and speed reduction before a horizontal curve). The findings demonstrated that the look of a road needs to convey a clear and unambiguous message to drivers. The transition to a two-star rural road is best achieved by making the road look like a typical two-star road as soon as possible.

AB  - This study examined driver perceptions of safety at metro and regional intersections with different types of control. Data was collected using an on-line survey with 696 participants drawn from the Royal Automobile Association of South Australia’s Member Panel. Results demonstrate a greater perception of safety associated with the use of roundabouts, yet a reduced perception of safety associated with a lesser known Safe System design of raised plateaus. Additionally, the results suggest that there is some confusion about the need to give way to other traffic at traditional controlled and uncontrolled intersections, further supporting the need for Safe System intersection designs.

AB  - Mildura Rural City Council’s Road Safety Strategic Plan embraces a Safe System approach to support a safe community. In delivering the Strategic Plan, a municipal speed limit review was undertaken and speed management plan developed. Revised speed limits, reflecting road environment rather than default limit, were proposed. The expected reduction in fatal and serious injury crashes associated with the proposed new speed limits were evaluated. Findings of the speed limit review, as well as expected fatal and serious injury crash savings are presented. The paper will also consider community response and acceptance of the proposed measures.

TI  - Comparing crashes: A Safe System analysis of serious injury and fatal crashes in New Zealand
PY  - 2018/10
SP  - 3p
AB  - Serious injuries account for the greatest proportion of the social costs of New Zealand’s road trauma, yet there is limited understanding of the differences in system failures between fatal crashes and those that result in serious injuries. Using a Safe System analysis framework, this research compared the circumstances of 200 serious injury crashes and 100 fatal crashes involving light vehicle occupants. This framework included criteria for ‘triggering’ each system pillar. The research shows that serious injury crashes are less likely than fatal crashes to involve complete system failure and that all pillars of the Safe System require attention if tangible road safety improvements are to be expected.

PY  - 2018/10
SP  - 4p
AB  - Progression towards Safe System goals of zero death and serious injury has stalled in Australia. Historical downward step-changes in road toll were associated with systemic and cultural shifts driven by government regulation (e.g. drink driving, seat belts). The goals of the current National Road Safety Strategy (NRSS) are not likely to be met by 2020, but significant opportunities lay beyond if more systemic approach to road safety strategies can be adopted. This paper discusses potential strategic contributions of Mobility Management (travel demand management, road pricing, urban planning, Mobility as a Service) to the next NRSS goals and points out the evidence necessary for detailed estimation of the next step-change in road toll.

PY  - 2018/10
SP  - 2p
AB  - The Safe System philosophy demands that risks be dealt with systematically. The Towards Zero Strategy attempts to introduce a systematic and proactive approach to dealing with risk on the road network. Enabling this approach has required changes to the role of Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) in project selection, prioritisation and approval. Historically projects have been required to meet minimum BCRs which are calculated using recent crash history. A new approach has been devised to enable Victoria’s Safe System Road Infrastructure Program (SSRIP) to deal proactively and systematically with safety risks.

PY  - 2018/10
SP  - 31p
AB  - There has been no significant reduction in the number of people killed or seriously injured on UK roads since 2010. A refreshed approach is needed. International good practice now recommends a performance management approach to road safety, adopting a small set of key performance indicators to focus attention on those interventions which have maximum impact on casualty numbers and to show the progress being made. Guidance on what to monitor is provided by WHO and others. Within this framework, each country needs to develop its own key indicator set to meet its circumstances and priorities. PACTS, in association with Ageas, has researched this and proposed a set of eight key indicators, with reasons, for the UK. These measure the intrinsic safety performance of the roads, vehicles, users and the emergency services. The indicators are 1. Traffic complying with speed limits on national roads 2. Traffic complying with speed limits on local roads 3. Drivers who do not drive after consuming alcohol or drugs 4. Car occupants using a seat belt or child seat 5. Drivers not using an in-car phone 6. Passenger cars with highest safety rating 7. Major roads with appropriate safety ratings 8. Emergency medical services arriving at priority accident scenes within 18 minutes. Many of these indicators can be measured by existing surveys at no additional cost; others will require some further investment by government.

AB  - This paper assesses the Safe System’s claim that zero fatal and serious injuries are possible and shows it is not possible and its pursuit will worsen safety. Similarly, the focus on fatal and serious injuries is likely to result in more, not fewer, fatal and serious injury crashes. Applying public health strategies (i.e. population-level remedies on the majority who are at low risk) to road safety is currently fashionable, even though studies show it is not effective. However, combined with the distorted claim that ‘life is sacrosanct’, it has permitted a system to evolve which seeks to control and micro-manage drivers to lower the road toll. The paper reviews available evidence on safety and speed and draws a comparison with the noble principles of the Communist manifesto to explain the unforeseen, unintended consequences. A completely different ‘Safety Star System’ is put forward to replace the Safe System and avoid these unintended consequences.

TI  - Safe Speed Limits for a Safe System: The Relationship between Speed Limit and Fatal Crash Rate for Different Crash Types
PY  - 2018/05
VL  - 19
IS  - 4
SP  - pp 404-408
AB  - The objective of this article is to provide empirical evidence for safe speed limits that will meet the objectives of the Safe System by examining the relationship between speed limit and injury severity for different crash types, using police-reported crash data.  Police-reported crashes from 2 Australian jurisdictions were used to calculate a fatal crash rate by speed limit and crash type. Example safe speed limits were defined using threshold risk levels.  A positive exponential relationship between speed limit and fatality rate was found. For an example fatality rate threshold of 1 in 100 crashes it was found that safe speed limits are 40 km/h for pedestrian crashes; 50 km/h for head-on crashes; 60 km/h for hit fixed object crashes; 80 km/h for right angle, right turn, and left road/rollover crashes; and 110 km/h or more for rear-end crashes.  The positive exponential relationship between speed limit and fatal crash rate is consistent with prior research into speed and crash risk. The results indicate that speed zones of 100 km/h or more only meet the objectives of the Safe System, with regard to fatal crashes, where all crash types except rear-end crashes are exceedingly rare, such as on a high standard restricted access highway with a safe roadside design.

AB  - This report provides a compendium of knowledge on Safe System treatments and identifies real world experience in the practical application of solutions that can mitigate crash severity. The Safe System is internationally regarded as the best practice approach to road safety. Although Australia and New Zealand have been early adopters of the approach since 2004, there has generally been a lack of clarity amongst practitioners on how best to integrate the approach into their daily activities. Assessment frameworks and tools are also now emerging that allow the alignment with Safe System be better quantified. A hierarchy of treatments is described that provide practitioners with a basic understanding of the types of practices that should now be applied on a trajectory towards a Safe System. Primary treatments are capable of virtually eliminating death and injury and certain supporting treatments can transform the network a step closer to reducing the overall harm being caused.

TI  - A Safe System Approach to Reduce Wrong-Way Driving Crashes on Divided Highways by Applying Access Management and Traffic Safety Culture
PY  - 2018
SP  - 18p
AB  - When compared to all other types of crashes, wrong-way driving (WWD) crashes are much more likely to result in serious injuries and fatalities. Specifically, on divided highways, the risk of fatality is 20 to 25 times greater. In part, this appears to be due to limitations in the current “3Es of Traffic Safety” strategies (Engineering, Education, and Enforcement). This paper proposes an expanded “Safe System Approach” to address the role of all components of the traffic system that may lead to crashes. This paper identifies three main strategies: Access Management (AM), Traffic Safety Culture (TSC), and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) / Connected Vehicle Systems (CVS). After describing each strategy, the paper focuses on AM and TSC. It is estimated that when the Safe System approach, as outlined in this paper, is universally applied, WWD crashes on divided highways will be significantly reduced.

TI  - A Safe System Based Investigation of Factors Influencing Bicycle Crash Severity in Victoria, Australia
PY  - 2018
SP  - 17p
AB  - Safe System approach has been adopted in Australia and New Zealand to manage vehicles, road and roadside infrastructure, and speeds to eliminate death and serious injury as a consequence of road crashes. In Australia, one main focus of road safety professionals is applying Safe System principles to reduce the number of death and serious injuries resulting from bicycle crashes. This study examined the effect of factors associated with three pillars of the Safe System approach on bicycle crash severity in Victoria, Australia. These pillars include ‘safe roads and roadsides’, ‘safe speeds’ and ‘safe road users’. The Victorian police-collected road crash information system (RCIS) database was used to conduct the analysis. A random parameter binary logit model was utilised to find out the effect of factors on bicycle crash severity. The results showed that traffic control and lighting condition were the ‘safe roads and roadsides’ related parameters influencing bicycle crash severity. Speed zone was also found as a significant factor under the ‘safe speeds’ pillar in the Safe System approach. Furthermore, bicyclist age, helmet use, intention (movement) and other road user intention (movement), were the other significant variables (i.e. related to ‘safe road users’ pillar) affecting the severity of bicycle crashes. The results also suggested that more in depth investigation of bicycle crash dynamics is required to achieve better understanding of the parameters influencing bicycle crash severity.

SP  - 123p
AB  - This report provides a synthesis of key safety solutions as well as issues that need to be considered when effectively addressing safety on urban mixed use arterial routes. Mixed use urban arterials account for a large proportion of high-severity crashes in Australia and New Zealand, particularly involving vulnerable road users. Austroads commissioned research to help identify solutions that might be applied on these arterial roads to improve safety through the provision of Safe System infrastructure. The project involved assessment of six case studies around Australia and New Zealand. Preliminary concept designs were developed for each of the routes based on the findings from the workshops and subsequent discussions. The likely safety benefits were assessed with estimates of likely crash reductions as well as alignment with the Safe System objective of eliminating death and serious injury.

SN  - 9781925671216
PY  - 2017/12
SP  - 108p
AB  - Intersection crashes account for approximately 30% of severe injuries in Australia and New Zealand. This study sought to improve understanding of the key factors in intersection severe injury crashes, and to develop initiatives to improve the design of intersections for better alignment with the Safe System objective of minimising death and serious injury. The study reviewed recent literature and data to synthesise the following Safe System intersection design principles: minimise conflict points, remove/simplify road user decisions, minimise impact angles, and minimise entry and impact speeds. Using inputs from literature and data findings, a new safety analytical method, and practitioners, the study proposed nine innovative intersection design concepts seeking to increase Safe System alignment across a wide range of scenarios (urban/rural, new/retrofit). These design concepts form a starting point for practitioners’ trials and refinement. The study concluded that achievement of Safe System for intersections requires significant supporting contributions from emerging transport disciplines such as C-ITS, autonomous vehicles, and Movement and Place.

TI  - A Safe System analysis of serious injury and fatal crashes
PY  - 2017/11
SP  - 11p
AB  - Currently, there is limited understanding of the differences in system failure between fatal crashes and those that result in serious injuries. Serious injuries account for the greatest proportion of the social costs of New Zealand’s road trauma. This research compared the circumstances of serious and fatal crashes, using a Safe System analysis framework, including the proportion of crashes where ‘reckless behaviour’ was exhibited. Following a scan of literature to guide the method, a Safe System analysis framework was developed, tested, and applied to 200 serious injury crashes and 100 fatal crashes involving light vehicle occupants. This included criteria for ‘triggering’ each system pillar. For the user pillar ‘reckless behaviour’ was also identified using an agreed set of criteria, and for the other pillars extraordinary factors were also identified. For both serious injury and fatal crashes there was significant involvement by all four pillars of the Safe System across the 300 crashes but serious injury crashes were less likely to involve all four pillars of the Safe System. Fatal crashes had a higher proportion of roadside objects and other vehicles struck, were more likely to involve narrow shoulders for run-off road crashes, were more likely to involve centreline crossing crashes on 100 km/h roads, and typically happened in higher speed environments. New vehicles typically had better outcomes in two-vehicle crashes and SUV’s/4WD’s and utes were more likely to roll-over. Multiple user factors were more likely in fatal crashes. Consistent with overseas literature, reckless behaviour was less common in serious injury crashes and across fatal and serious crashes, multiple system failures as opposed to reckless behaviour was more common. The research shows that serious injury crashes are less likely than fatal crashes to involve complete system failure and that all pillars of the Safe System require attention if tangible road safety improvements are to be expected.

While there have been many innovative road safety treatments successfully trialled and evaluated, their introduction into mainstream road planning and design has been very slow. This paper draws on innovation management and agile product development techniques to propose a streamlined innovation pathway to fast-track development, trialling and adoption of new Safe System road infrastructure solutions.

SP  - 2p
AB  - The Safe System is built on the principles that death and serious injury are an unacceptable trade-off, having considered that humans make mistakes and that humans can only tolerate certain forces. There are five key elements: Safe Roads; Safe Speeds; Safe Vehicles; Safe People and Post-Crash Response. The introduction of autonomous vehicles is leading to a shift in the way the road safety challenge should be framed. This paper discusses, with real world application, the way in which the Safe System should be adapted for an AV world.

AB  - Safe System principles are an accepted part of road safety strategies in Victoria, Australia. The underpinnings are that humans are fallible and will inevitably make mistakes when driving, riding, or walking. Nevertheless, road trauma is not inevitable. No one should be killed or seriously injured on our roads. Consequently, to prevent serious trauma, the road system must be forgiving, so that collision forces do not exceed limits that the human body can tolerate. At a national level, the Australian Government has committed to the Safe System. In recent years, translating the agreed philosophical aspirations of the Safe System into practical application has been challenging. Also, assessing a project’s alignment with Safe System principles has caused much debate and consternation.  A key change in thinking has been that a hazard free and driveable roadside (clear zone) is less likely to reduce the likelihood of fatal or serious injuries when compared to shielding the entire roadside with continuous safety barrier treatments. This paper examines the concept of a “Safe System compliant” roadside and reflects on the site-specific constraints that have influenced the use of safety barriers in the projects assessed.  In February 2016, Austroads (the association of Australian and New Zealand Road Transport and Traffic Authorities) published AP-R509-16 Safe System Assessment Framework to provide guidance in assessing a project’s alignment with the principles of the Safe System approach.  This paper reviews the application of this framework draws on case studies of three significantly different roadside safety projects which have sought to incorporate Safe System principles.

TI  - The Robustly-Safe Automated Driving System for Enhanced Active Safety
PY  - 2017/03/28
AB  - Road safety is one of the major concerns for automated vehicles. In order for these vehicles to interact safely and efficiently with the other road participants, the behavior of the automated vehicles should be carefully designed. Liu and Tomizuka proposed the Robustly-safe Automated Driving system (ROAD) which prevents or minimizes occurrences of collisions of the automated vehicle with other road participants while maintaining efficiency. In this paper, a set of design principles are elaborated as an extension of the previous work, including robust perception and cognition algorithms for environment monitoring and high level decision making and low level control algorithms for safe maneuvering of the automated vehicle. The autonomous driving problem in mixed traffic is posed as a stochastic optimization problem, which is solved by 1) behavior classification and trajectory prediction of other road participants, and 2) a unique parallel planner architecture which addresses the efficiency goal in the long term and the safety goal in the short term separately. Moreover, a python-based high fidelity simulation system is developed and extensive simulations are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, where both high level decision making and low level vehicle regulation are considered. Two typical scenarios are studied, driving on freeway and driving in unstructured environments such as parking lots. In the simulation, multiple moving agents representing surrounding vehicles and pedestrians are added to the environment, some of which are controlled by human subjects in order to test the real time response of the automated vehicle.

AB  - Making urban cycling a safer and more attractive transport choice is now a NZ Transport Agency strategic priority. Currently, road trauma for cycling is lower than other modes; however, unless a safer system for cyclists is developed, including more effective cycling education, an increase in road trauma is likely with increased investment and promotion. The research first identified key cycle safety interventions through the development and application of a cycling safety system model. The development of this model, a first for New Zealand, was informed by contemporary models of crash causation, which examined distal and proximal crash causation factors. Key findings were the need for a strong mandate and strategic direction for cycling, and improved systems to provide for cyclists in road design. Second, the report provides guidance on how best to prepare New Zealanders for utility cycling, drawing on key literature and engagement with stakeholders and end users. The need for consistent and comprehensive approaches, involving a variety of initiatives and touch points over the course of people’s lives, were indicated. Together, these two distinctly different, yet complementary, pieces of work provide actionable recommendations that can improve safety for cyclists and facilitate increased cycling uptake.

AB  - Safe System principles and Vision Zero for road safety are delivering successes in many countries.  However, interpretations of the approach limit advocacy for road safety in two ways: The push for road safety investment and action based on a moral imperative for zero road crash deaths is uncompelling for many critical audiences; The approach is dismissed in many low and middle income countries (and even high income jurisdictions) because the prevention of all road crash deaths is seen as prohibitively expensive and unrealistic. Recommendations are made to address these limitations, in order to re-invigorate the adoption of Safe System principles.

AB  - Road users such as pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists are highly susceptible to crash forces. Yet, while Safe System thinking accords susceptibility to crash forces and a forgiving system as focal principles, the greater vulnerability of these road users is barely recognised in many models of a Safe System. This is a concern of growing importance, given current efforts to increase usage of active travel modes and substantially rising injury rates among cyclists and motorcyclists. This paper explores a selection of research studies aiming to identify relevant factors behind traffic conflicts involving vulnerable road users, as a means to determine appropriate countermeasures particularly those involving infrastructure and vehicle technology. A better understanding of the contextual nature and causes of traffic conflict has much potential to contribute to Safe System thinking and conceptualisations, allowing them to extend beyond their traditional focus on susceptibility to crash forces and systems that are forgiving.

AB  - A 1,500-km existing conditions road safety audit of the central trunk corridor road of Tanzania saw aggressive and unsafe overtaking by full-size buses, mini-buses, and trucks, with large numbers of cyclists and pedestrians traveling in the shoulder, in groups and with very wide loads. A large proportion of the safety barriers were substandard by design or installation and not capable of containing large vehicles. When damaged, it often takes years to repair the barriers due to lack of funding. The audit route passed through 80 villages and eight major towns between Morogoro and the Tanzania–Rwanda border. The purpose of the road safety audit was to examine themes and strategic safety issues rather than identifying and tabulating each individual specific issue or hazard. Recommendations had to take account of the very limited resources in construction and maintenance. This paper examines key recommendations from a Safe System perspective.  Understanding that there are limited resources, recommendations attempted to be realistic and have the greatest benefit for the money spent, regardless of whether they were primary or supporting Safe System treatments. Indeed, a core finding on this highway in Tanzania was that the Safe System supporting treatment of basic delineation will most likely provide much greater safety benefits than spending scarce resources on safety barriers (primary treatment).

SP  - pp 28-37
AB  - The safe system approach is driven by a first principle–based policy that aims for zero deaths and zero serious injuries on our roads. This paper proposes that the first treatment of choice, in terms of lane departure crashes, should be the use of a technically advanced road safety countermeasure: the road safety barrier. This outcome-based, first-principles approach aims to prevent any vehicle from leaving the road and entering the roadside, particularly in rural higher speed environments. This paper will provide examples of this philosophy applied to brownfield sites in Victoria and highlight the limitations with current design practice for greenfield sites. This paper will review recent research to demonstrate that the current standards-based approach of using clear-zone principles is inadequate based on Safe System principles. This paper aims to promote discussion as well as a change of policy, standards and guidelines, to enable road safety practitioners to implement the Safe System approach with the first principle being for a vehicle to not leave the road or enter the roadside.

PY  - 2016/11
SP  - 12p
AB  - Conventional at-grade intersection designs present a significant challenge in the context of meeting the Safe System vision of preventing fatal and serious injuries. The combination of multiple conflict points and physical characteristics of some of these conflicts lead to high probability of sustaining fatal and serious injuries in at-grade intersection crashes. This paper outlines an analytical method for estimating risk of severe injuries at intersections. The method, X-KEMM-X, draws on previous published and new research by the authors on conflict point analysis, intersection geometry and the relationship between impact speed and severe injury probability. The method is used to assess the probability of a fatal or serious injury outcome in a crash at selected conventional at-grade intersection types. Then, a series of innovative Safe System-aligned intersection designs are evaluated using the same method. The paper compares these designs suggesting principles for Safe System intersection design guidance. The paper concludes with a discussion about the potential of X-KEMM-X method as a tool for quantitative Safe System evaluation of future road and intersection designs.

SP  - various files
AB  - This report describes a paradigm shift in road safety policy, being led by a handful of countries, according to the principles of a Safe System. A Safe System is based on the premise that road crashes are both predictable and preventable, and that it is possible to move towards zero road deaths and serious injuries. This, however, requires a fundamental rethink of the governance and implementation of road safety policy. To stem the road death epidemic, the United Nations have set the target of halving traffic fatalities by 2020. Every year, 1.25 million people are killed in road crashes and up to 50 million are seriously injured. Road crashes kill more people than malaria or tuberculosis and are among the ten leading causes of death. Their economic cost is estimated at 2-5% of GDP in many countries. Written by a group of international road safety experts, this report provides leaders in government, administrations, business and academia with emerging best practices and the starting point to chart their own journeys towards a Safe System.

AB  - Australia adopted the Safe System approach more than a decade ago. The first action item from the Australian National Road Safety Strategy is to ensure that all new road projects consider Safe System principles. Although the main objectives of this approach are clear, there is limited direct guidance on how this can be implemented, especially in the provision of road infrastructure. Austroads has developed a tool to directly address this issue. A framework is presented that assists in assessing how closely road design and operation align with the Safe System objectives, and in clarifying which elements need to be modified to achieve closer alignment with Safe System objectives. A treatment hierarchy was also developed to identify effective Safe System infrastructure solutions. The development of both the assessment framework and treatment hierarchy are discussed.

Trial results from the combined treatment of signals, reduced speed limits and a Safety Platform indicate lower speeds at the trial site when compared to control intersections. Due to the combination of treatment, the direct effect of the Safety Platform on the lowered speed is not as clear, and will need to be investigated at the next stage of trial.

AB  - Before the release of the Austroads Safe System Assessment Framework, Safe System Solutions Pty Ltd developed a methodology and template to advance road safety praxis by undertaking Safe System Audits. This paper outlines the principles of Safe System Auditing and uses as a case study - the Safe System Audit for the ACT Government in relation to on-road intersection activities such as windscreen washing, entertaining, collecting, selling and advertising. The outcomes of the audit were a set of fifteen recommendations grouped into categories; safer road and roadside treatments, for safer vehicles, for safer road users, and for safer speeds.

AB  - The Safe System Approach states that no pedestrian should be killed or injured using the transport system. While the key underlying principles of the Safe System Approach are generally well-understood, the translation of its premises into practice is not yet fully realized. Using the Kinetic Energy Management Model, we developed a framework to study pedestrian crash and injury risks. We developed a practical guide, consisting of pedestrian safety infrastructural measures, to address pedestrian crash and injury risk. We believe the guide will provide the necessary tool to address pedestrian safety issues, in an effective and Safe System compliant manner.

TI  - Operational and System Hazard Analysis in a Safe Systems Requirement Engineering Process – Application to Automotive Industry
PY  - 2016/08
VL  - 87
SP  - pp 256-268
AB  - Automotive engineers have to meet evolving customer expectations, particularly growing concerns for safety, by introducing new sophisticated devices like Line Keeping Assistance, Collision Mitigation Braking System or Pedestrian Detection. These devices are composed of electrical components. They are likely to be subject to failures that may impact automobile safety, which means the safety of the vehicle occupants or pedestrians. Recent standards like ISO 26262 aim at mitigating these safety problems. Automobile engineers must prove that they perform safety studies along the design process. Meanwhile, they have to cope with other changes in their engineering practices. Due to the goals of verifying the satisfaction of all requirements, the design offices have introduced new practices based on Systems Engineering (SE) which are based on models. SE tools or processes are based on a functional approach of the system in which dysfunctional aspects are missing. Thus, there is a need to integrate the safety domain into the SE framework in order to improve safety studies and the collaboration between systems engineers and safety specialists. This paper analyzes this issue by focusing on the definition of high-level (or vehicle-level) safety requirements. It proposes a Safe Systems Requirement Engineering Process and a method named Operational and System Hazard Analysis (O&SHA) that helps to specify the high-level safety requirements (called safety goals in ISO 26262). It is based on a Model-Based Systems Engineering approach (MBSE) which integrates safety aspects. The added value of the proposed method is illustrated by applying it to two case studies.

SN  - 9781925451122
PY  - 2016/04
SP  - 99p
AB  - Australian and New Zealand local governments manage extensive road networks. Previous reporting indicates local government-managed roads represent 82 and 88% of the length of all public roads in both countries, respectively. As local roads, they tend to carry significantly smaller traffic volumes than the state road networks; however, analysis shows they contribute to more than half of all casualties resulting from road crashes, and an estimated 40 and 46% of fatalities. The lower exposure combined with the relatively high proportion of casualty crash severity means the risk to drivers on local government-managed roads is estimated to be up to twice that faced on state roads. Several factors combine to make implementing best practice Safe System infrastructure improvements a concern for local government. However, local councils are in a unique position of being able to harness the commitment and resources from across their organisations, including the elected representatives and local community, to support changes in road user attitudes as well as road planning, design, construction and maintenance to achieve incremental improvements that can make an impact on road safety and contribute to achieving national road safety objectives. The Safe System Hierarchy of Control seeks to provide local government with a tool that can be used by technical and non-technical practitioners and that can be used to help communicate road safety risk and risk countermeasures to council management, elected representatives and the community.

It provides information on treatments that can be used to address speed at intersections and midblock locations. The intention in using these treatments is to move closer to Safe System objectives by helping to avoid death and serious injury when crashes do occur. The main focus is on road engineering based treatments but information is also provided on other approaches that may be used (e.g. enforcement and in vehicle devices).

TI  - Towards a safe system approach to prevent health loss among motorcyclists: the importance of motorcycle stability as a condition for integrated safety
SN  - 9789175973760
PY  - 2016
IS  - 4057
SP  - 66
AB  - Health loss among motorcyclists is a global road safety problem for which innovative countermeasures are needed. While the traditional motorcycle safety approach has focused on protective gear and rider education, the Safe System approach adopted in Sweden and other countries implies that the road, the vehicle and the road user, in conjunction with a safe speed limit, should interact to create a safe road transport system. Motorcycles are intrinsically unstable vehicles and the most likely consequence of instability is the rider becoming separated from the motorcycle. In this case, the only countermeasures to avoid health loss are the rider's protective gear, or a forgiving road infrastructure. The overall aim of this thesis is to understand the chain of events leading to crashes involving motorcycles with Antilock Braking Systems (ABS), compared to similar motorcycles without ABS. This resulted in five studies based on real-life crash data from Sweden, Norway, Spain and Italy. The integrated chain of events was used as a theoretical framework: the chain of events leading to a crash is no longer seen in separate blocks; rather it is a process in which one factor in the early phases of the chain can affect the following ones, thus creating conditions for other countermeasures to be effective. The findings indicated that Motorcycle ABS reduced emergency care visits by 47%. The severity of the crashes that did occur was lower, which reduced the overall risk of sustaining impairing injuries, although leg injuries were not addressed to the same extent. It was also found that almost 90% of fatal crashes with ABS were upright.

AB  - When designers or consulting engineers are charged with designing a project without the correct direction or network-wide context, the result will be an inconsistent network comprising project driven standards or a network vision which will never be met. A project designer is not in the right position to fully understand the context to make the right decision for driver consistency and for an achievable total network solution. A truly proactive means to address the problem is to consider a total network implementation through vision standards for road stereotypes. Doing this at the network planning phase so that network level design analysis is undertaken.

AB  - The Safe System requires a paradigm shift in the way road designers and project managers think about road safety. Road designers, builders, operators and those that manage roads all have a key role in providing a road that is safe for all users. This paper outlines various deficiencies in the traditional road design philosophy and proposes a new road design approach based on the Safe System. Key milestones include its adoption as a guiding principle for the United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety (2011-2020). The traditional "blame the victim" approach is contested. The science behind the Safe System and "what works" is well established. This paper provides a brief summary of the key principles to designing a safe road. The next step is to ensure the systematic application of these principles in road design.

TI  - Qatar's school safety program: applying Safe System principles
PY  - 2016
VL  - 27
IS  - 3
SP  - 11-21
AB  - Children's safety is a priority outside schools where there is often a mix of vulnerable road users and high numbers of vehicles. This paper outlines some of the issues presented by schools in Qatar and provides an overview of how the Safe System approach has been incorporated into school zone improvements. Protecting children who by their nature are unpredictable and impulsive, around schools has always been a sensitive safety issue. It is a key Safe System principle that the road user is not blamed for the crash and that other measures are developed to manage safety. Likewise, it is unrealistic to rely on motorist's willingness to comply with speed limits in order to create a safe speed environment. Across the globe school zone programs have reasoned that any reduction in vehicle travel speed is evidence of success. This argument does not align with Safe Systems principles and more is required. The Qatar experience is proposed as a Safe System model for developing and implementing Safe School Zones.

AB  - The key objectives of this research were to identify the contribution that urban public transport (PT), which is generally considered safer than travel by light motor vehicles, can make to the Safe System approach, and to develop an implementation plan for the insertion of PT as a safe mode into the Safer Journeys framework and action plans. The work indicated that, as in New Zealand, the practice overseas was for road safety strategists not to attempt to influence modal split in the direction of safer PT modes, but rather to accept the levels of modal split resulting from government PT policies and then to ensure that the system which results is managed according to Safe System principles. This would mean including in Safer Journeys PT-related injuries not at present covered in Safer Journeys actions. This would require no structural change, just a restatement of the reach of the strategy and the inclusion of some new areas of interest and action plans. To achieve this, the whole journey rather than just the road phase needs consideration. Data on injury related to all aspects of the journey should be gathered and analysed; safety expertise can be positioned in organisational structures to influence how PT is operated, and tools to better monitor PT safety can be made available and used.

TI  - Improving the performance of safe system infrastructure: final report
SN  - 9781925294835
PY  - 2015/11
SP  - 121p
AB  - This report summarises the findings of a three-year study which reviewed the safety performance of selected road infrastructure elements and provided solutions that were more closely aligned with the Safe System ideal. The review examined the performance of signalised intersections, roundabouts and wire rope barriers. The solutions were developed following a literature review, statistical analysis of site data, in-depth crash data analysis, and expert guidance. The review found that the safety performance of signalised intersections can be improved by managing high entry speeds and unfavourable impact angles using signalised roundabouts, and horizontal and vertical deflections on entry. Roundabouts showing poor safety outcomes for cyclists and motorcyclists can be made safer by reducing approach and entry speeds. In these cases, tighter geometric design or additional supporting infrastructure can help reduced speeds. Wire rope barriers were seen to deliver positive safety improvements relative to other roadside design options. Guidance refinement could further optimise safety outcomes.

TI  - Safe System Auditing: principles to practice
PY  - 2015/10
SP  - 8p
AB  - The Safe System is a road safety philosophy that requires the road system to be designed and managed so that death and serious injury are avoidable. It consists of four core interrelated components: safer roads, safer speeds, safer vehicles, and safer people.  It is a well-known principle that has been philosophically adopted by road authorities such as VicRoads.  Converting the principle into action has been slower – because the natural tendency when undertaking infrastructure projects is to adopt normal practice and follow existing guidelines. Safe System Auditing is one tool being used by VicRoads to convert Safe System principles into practice.  Safe System Auditing is the formal safety examination of a road related program, project or initiative such as: an existing road, intersection or length; a road investment project, whether at feasibility, design or pre-opening stage; a community road safety program or funding application; a road transport policy or strategy. Safe System Audits distinctly 'raise the bar' beyond the work of a Road Safety Audit (RSA). A RSA qualitatively estimates and reports on potential road safety issues against current standards and guidelines but only identifies opportunities for improvements in safety in this 'limited' perspective, however a SSA measures compliance with Safe System principles which can, and does, push outcomes to a higher level - while at the same time considering realistic constraints. VicRoads has engaged Safe System Solutions Pty Ltd to undertake a number of Safe System Audits of infrastructure projects the results of which will be described in this paper.

TI  - Safe system roads for local government
PY  - 2015/10
SP  - 10p
AB  - The Safe System approach to road safety has been in place in Australasia for over a decade, but understanding and application by local road practitioners remains limited. The Austroads project Safe System Roads for Local Government (ST1769) is seeking to develop guidance for local government practitioners on how to assess sites of concern and identify how they can be best treated using the principles of the Safe System approach.  The project is ongoing but nearing completion; this paper provides an overview of the approach developed from this project. Through crash data analysis and consultation with the project working group of Australian jurisdictions and the NZ Road Controlling Authorities forum, this paper discusses the significance of local government roads and their contribution to road trauma in both countries. It provides an understanding of the challenges faced by local government to address safety on local roads, discussing the funding challenges, network responsibilities and sets out key focus areas for high severity crashes in a range of relevant environments. This paper highlights practical tools that have or are being developed, including the benefits of using GIS spatial analysis, mapping network risk based on iRAP risk measures to optimise safety efforts, giving an understanding of network risk, identifying high priority sites and achieving effective prioritisation. Finally, using a case study example, the paper outlines the Safe System assessment method intended to be available to local government practitioners, detailing example interventions, their relevant application and Safe System focus. The guide specifically looks to provide a practical, cost effective toolkit of interventions that will assist Local Government to move towards providing a safe system on their road networks.

TI  - Greater understanding of rear-end crashes in a safe system
PY  - 2015/10
SP  - 7p
AB  - Rear-end crashes contribute a significant proportion of the total fatal and serious injury (FSI) crashes occurring on Australian roads.  Despite accounting for less than 2% of fatal crashes on Australian and New Zealand roads, this crash type accounts for an estimated 16% of serious injury crashes on urban roads and approximately 8% on rural roads. As such, road safety professionals seeking to drive down FSI crashes need to consider methods of addressing this crash type. As rear-end crashes are generally less severe than other crash types, it may be tempting to assume that these crashes do not warrant attention when addressing crashes resulting in fatal or serious injuries. Further, since it is not possible to physically separate or shield the striking vehicle from the struck vehicle, developing options to treat the rear-end crash problem may be considered to consume too many resources for too little benefit. This extended abstract describes the findings of an Austroads’ study to identify factors contributing to the incidence and severity of rear-end crashes and treatments to reduce their occurrence or mitigate their severity. The study involved a literature review, detailed analysis of 5 years of crash data from Australia and New Zealand, and a comparison of common factors at crash sites in several states. The extended abstract discusses options within the four Safe System pillars for addressing rear-end crashes in order to answer the question: Is it worthwhile investing our resources in treating this crash type?

TI  - Creating a safe system compliant highway network: the challenges of implementing a safe system approach, through the Safer Journeys initiative, in New Zealand
PY  - 2015/03
SP  - 18p
AB  - The Safer Journey initiative was adopted by New Zealand in 2011 and the first action plan launched. The challenge for road corridor designers is to translate the principles associated with this initiative into tangible features of that corridor that identifiably contribute to reductions in fatal and serious injuries. Although New Zealand is an active member of the Austroads consortium and the Austroads Guides are our primary source of guidance, there is a strong desire to put guidelines into place that would result in the safe system desired outcomes sooner than would be addressed by the revisions to the Austroads Guides. An immediate concern was the accelerated programme for the Roads of National Significance; a series of corridors around the country that are of strategic importance. It is critical that these roads are constructed and operated to the latest expected levels of safety. Subsequently, the principles are being adapted to be applied to the rural, single lane and often highly constrained contexts. The technical memorandum used to deliver this advice includes a detailed, &lsquo;whole-of-life&rsquo; benefit assessment as well as background information that helps the designer assess the most appropriate treatments bearing in mind the safety problem that is being addressed. This paper will detail and discuss the engineering rationale applied and the challenge of translating the safe system principles into such road corridor features and feedback the level of implementation achieved so far.

TI  - Developing a risk prediction model for a safe system signature project
PY  - 2015/03
SP  - 11p
AB  - The Safer Journeys Action Plan 2013-2015 identifies safe system signature projects as a strategic action to achieve the Safer Journeys vision. The rural roads of the Eastern Bay of Plenty (EBoP) region were identified as an area where a signature project has the potential to make demonstrable advances in reducing road trauma for all road users. This paper describes a GIS-based curve risk prediction model that has been developed as part of the EBoP signature project. This included the development of methodology that uses GIS to identify curves, predict vehicle operating speeds along road corridors, and assess curve risk using approach speeds and radius. The results of this methodology display a high correlation between high risk curves and the occurrence of loss-of-control crashes. The outputs of this project include the &lsquo;SignatureNET&rsquo; web viewer, a tool that enables all the signature project partners to view road safety data and make well-informed road safety investment decisions. This tool can be rolled out across other regions using existing GIS data and methodologies, and will be of interest to road controlling authorities wanting to target loss-of-control crashes on rural roads. Both the web viewer and curve assessment methodology also demonstrate that innovative assessment methods and tools can be developed within a safe systems signature project environment.

TI  - Assessing the ‘system’ in safe systems-based road designs: Using cognitive work analysis to evaluate intersection designs
PY  - 2015/01
VL  - 74
SP  - pp 324-338
AB  - While a safe systems approach has long been acknowledged as the underlying philosophy of contemporary road safety strategies, systemic applications are sparse. This article argues that systems-based methods from the discipline of Ergonomics have a key role to play in road transport design and evaluation. To demonstrate, the Cognitive Work Analysis framework was used to evaluate two road designs – a traditional Melbourne intersection and a cut-through design for future intersections based on road safety safe systems principles. The results demonstrate that, although the cut-through intersection appears different in layout from the traditional intersection, system constraints are not markedly different. Furthermore, the analyses demonstrated that redistribution of constraints in the cut-through intersection resulted in emergent behaviour, which was not anticipated and could prove problematic. Further, based on the lack of understanding of emergent behaviour, similar design induced problems are apparent across both intersections. Specifically, incompatibilities between infrastructure, vehicles and different road users were not dealt with by the proposed design changes. The importance of applying systems methods in the design and evaluation of road transport systems is discussed.

TI  - Safe system approach to reducing serious injury risk in motorcyclist collisions with fixed hazards
PY  - 2015/01
VL  - 74
SP  - pp 290-296
AB  - Collisions with fixed objects in the roadway environment account for a substantial proportion of motorcyclist fatalities. Many studies have identified individual roadway environment and/or motorcyclist characteristics that are associated with the severity of the injury outcome, including the presence of roadside barriers, helmet use, alcohol use and speeding. However, no studies have reported the cumulative benefit of such characteristics on motorcycling safety. The safe system approach recognises that the system must work as a whole to reduce the net injury risk to road users to an acceptable level, including the four system cornerstone areas of roadways, speeds, vehicles and people. The aim of the present paper is to consider these cornerstone areas concomitantly, and quantitatively assess the serious injury risk of motorcyclists in fixed object collisions using this holistic approach. A total of 1006 Australian and 15,727 (weighted) United States motorcyclist-fixed object collisions were collected retrospectively, and the serious injury risks associated with roadside barriers, helmet use, alcohol use and speeding were assessed both individually and concomitantly. The results indicate that if safety efforts are made in each of the safe system cornerstone areas, the combined effect is to substantially reduce the serious injury risk of fixed hazards to motorcyclists. The holistic approach is shown to reduce the serious injury risk considerably more than each of the safety efforts considered individually. These results promote the use of a safe system approach to motorcycling safety.

AB  - Fatal and serious injury crashes persist at intersections despite current efforts to address this. Little research specifically investigates the role played by existing intersection design in perpetuating serious intersection crash outcomes despite an increasing move to incorporate Safe System design on to roads. This paper identifies design principles deemed important to align intersection design with Safe System approaches, including exploring the impact of speed and angle on overall kinetic energy of a crash. Existing as well as new intersection designs are presented that are believed to incorporate the identified principles. An assessment is made of the alignment of the new and existing designs with the identified principles.

AB  - In 2007, the evolution of a more effective and practical approach for achieving road safety started to evolve as a substantial attempt was made to implement the Safe System Approach on the highest value road project of the day in Western Australia. It complemented established road safety processes by better identifying and prioritising the road safety risks and guiding a more effective and holistic mitigation strategy. The success led to the application of the approach on further projects and the approach was taken to the world. When demonstrated to the ASANRA Traffic Safety Committee in Zimbabwe in 2013 (alongside the Road Safety Audit and Inspection processes), it was considered to be highly applicable to the context, easier to apply and more effective. Eight years of experience have now culminated in the Safe Road System Process (SRSP) process. This paper explains the SRSP process and guides its application.

AB  - Motorcyclists are among the most vulnerable road users. For motorcyclists in Victoria, Australia, the likelihood of serious injury or death in a crash is 34 times higher than for the occupants of a car. Although a combination of factors are generally at play in any crash, the engineering of the road surface and environment can have a significant impact on both the possibility of avoiding a crash and on the severity of injury to a motorcyclist should a crash occur. To address this issue, VicRoads commissioned a review of engineering design and maintenance standards, which then informed the development of a communications strategy - Making Roads Motorcycle Friendly. This paper provides the content, delivery and the evaluation of this world-first technical training package for road engineers, designers and operators. The paper then extends the communications strategy to deal with some of the key design issues involved in roads, roundabouts and motorcycles. Making Roads Motorcycle Friendly is a Victorian Motorcycle Advisory Council endorsed project, funded by the Transport Accident Commission Motorcycle Safety Levy and  delivered by VicRoads and Safe System Solutions Pty Ltd. It is a two hour seminar designed to raise awareness of the vulnerability of motorcyclists in terms of the road environment and highlight how road design/construction and maintenance/reinstatement works can be performed in ways that improve safety for motorcyclists. Over 800 Victorian engineers, road designers and maintenance staff have undertaken the training and an independent evaluation of the training package included an analysis of: 1) the post session evaluation forms (conducted immediately after each session);  2) the results of an electronic survey to participants; and 3) telephone interviews 5 to 15 months after seminars. The Victorian Making Roads Motorcycle Friendly resource and structure has now been used as the basis of the Western Australian, New South Wales and New Zealand versions of the training package. Following this overview of the communications strategy, the paper reports the results of an in-depth engineering investigation of some roundabouts in Victoria where motorcycle crashes have occurred and provides an illustrative example of design for motorcycle safety by examining roundabout design, maintenance and operation including turbo roundabouts.

AB  - The new Road Safety Manual (RSM) is designed to help countries at every stage of infrastructure development to fulfill road safety objectives. It is aligned with key pillars for the United Nationals Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020: Pillar 1: Road Safety Management; Pillar 2: Safer Roads and Mobility; Pillar 4: Safer Road Users. This comprehensive resource builds on the broad range of knowledge and experience provided by PIARC in the first edition. It includes new thinking on road safety and offers a clear argument on why adopting a Safe System approach is crucial for your country. The Safe System approach aims for a more forgiving road system that takes human fallibility and vulnerability into account. Under the Safe System approach, everyone (public agencies, automobile manufacturers, road users, enforcement officials, and others) must share the responsibility for road safety outcomes. The manual is split into three parts and can be downloaded in chapters. Key principles for each of the topics are included and discussed in the sections, with case studies and links to detailed technical material and other references.

AB  - The rural roads of New Zealand&rsquo;s Eastern Bay of Plenty (EBoP) region were identified as an area where a signature project has the potential to make demonstrable advances in reducing road trauma for all road users. This paper describes a new risk prediction methodology that identifies high-risk curves independent of crash history. Using geospatial data and innovative analysis techniques, existing methodologies for identifying curves and calculating vehicle operating speeds were modelled and automated to undertake a network-wide assessment of high risk curves. The new methodology extracted and classified almost 7000 curves across 500km of road network. When compared to the location of loss-of-control crashes, it was found that 66.6% of crashes occurred on 20.3% of curves classified as &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; in at least one direction. These results have been shared with road controlling authorities and will support prioritised road safety improvements targeting high risk curves.

TI  - Safe system approach. The expectations and challenges
SN  - 978-3-2812-1918-2
PY  - 2014/11
SP  - 83-6
AB  - The safe system approach is comprised of a few closely interlinked levels of action. The overall goal, however, remains the same: to focus on road safety and to develop a road system which will eradicate the occurance of road victims. The paper highlights the relationship between road safety and traffic psychology. This topic is critical as it relates to the current discussion concerning road safety and the new philosophy of action known as the safe system approach. Firstly, a brief overview of the new approach is outlined. Secondly, the work of Prof. Ralf Risser is used to illustrate whether goals - which are also common to the "Fit to drive conference" - have been realized. Finally, some strategies for the future work are proposed.

TI  - The Safe System eLearning module: a capacity building initiative
PY  - 2014/11
SP  - 6p
AB  - The TAC developed an eLearning module to assist all members of staff to understand and be able to describe the principles of the Safe System. As a leader in road safety, recognised internationally, the TAC is committed to developing road safety capacity throughout the organisation. The module was developed to support the actions of the Victorian Road Safety Strategy 2013-2022, which aims to reduce serious injuries and fatalities by more than 30 percent. The module was developed by an experienced online learning organisation through a defined program management framework and included consultation and stages of review by the Victorian road safety partners. The module was deployed to all staff from the beginning of April 2014 for a period of four weeks. The resource is now available on-line and accessible to any organisation or individual. For organisations with a learning management system, it can be downloaded and allocated to staff, as was the case for the TAC. This paper will describe the project development, deployment and evaluation by the TAC, along with providing outcomes for other organisations that have accessed the module.

TI  - Speed limit setting and the Safe System principle
PY  - 2014/11
SP  - 11p
AB  - The Safe System policy dictates that speed limits for the road and traffic system use human biomechanical and human competency as the design parameter to set the values. Taking crash injury severity factors into account research into the physics of crashes has determined when the physical forces will be too great for the human body to tolerate. Despite the formal adoption of the Safe System principles by all Australian Governments in 2004, no Australian State has adopted recommended Safe System speed limits. While most Australian States are not yet fully applying Safe System principles to speed zoning, this paper analyses New South Wales practices as an example. The current NSW Speed Zoning Guidelines, while transitionally moving towards a Safe System approach, explicitly aim to guide the setting of speed limits to &ldquo;ensure that they are practical and balance mobility, road safety and community concerns.&rdquo; Part of the problem for governments introducing safe speed limits is the amount of vocal opposition to lowering the limits. This paper identifies a number of specific departures from the Safe System approach inherent in the setting of speed limits as well as some of the ways that community attitudes might be shifted to promote better acceptance of safer speeds.

TI  - Making roundabouts a Safe System solution for motorcyclists
PY  - 2014/11
SP  - 10p
AB  - Motorcyclists are very vulnerable road users. In Victoria, riders account for 15% of deaths and serious injuries. Over 30% of motorcycle crashes occur at intersections (VicRoads Road Crash Information System (RCIS)). Roundabouts are considered a &lsquo;Safe System solution&rsquo; for intersections because they constrain speeds and impact angles to within biomechanically tolerable levels. VicRoads Safer Roads Infrastructure Program Guidelines (2012) estimate that a roundabout will reduce overall casualty crashes by 85%. Although roundabouts are a positive road safety treatment for motorcyclists they do not show as dramatic a reduction in road trauma as they do for cars. Scully et al. (2006) and Schoon and van Minnen (1993) estimate that roundabouts only reduce causality crashes for motorcyclists by between 36% and 77%. Between 2008 and 2012, there were 159 motorcyclists killed and seriously injured at roundabouts in Victoria. This represents 25% of all serious and fatal crashes at roundabouts (RCIS). This paper reviews roundabout design, maintenance and operation that may influence motorcycle safety. This includes turbo-roundabouts. It also reports the results of an in-depth engineering investigation of some roundabouts in Victoria where motorcycle crashes have occurred. Factors identified and discussed include; geometric design, sight distance, lighting, pavement markings, signing, landscaping, street furniture, speed limits and surface issues. This paper begins the work requested in the 2013 Austroads report Improving the Performance of Safe System Infrastructure wherein it states: &ldquo;Despite the positive [road safety] results, the two-wheeler risks at roundabouts need to be further reduced in order to reach the Safe System objectives.&rdquo;

TI  - Designing a safe system for vulnerable road users in Inner Melbourne
PY  - 2014/11
SP  - 9p
AB  - Road safety policy makers and practitioners subscribe to the safe system. This presentation asks how well the prevailing understanding and application of the safe system serves the needs of vulnerable road users. It will present a conceptual framework for the safe system that puts vulnerable road users first - in practice as well as in theory. Inner Melbourne has a high and ever growing concentration of pedestrians, cyclists, public transport users and motorcyclists. The number of people accessing the region by these modes for education, employment and entertainment continues to grow strongly. It also has a rapidly increasing residential population. It is a 24 hour city. While Inner Melbourne has few fatalities, it does have a large representation of pedestrian and cyclist serious injuries. The presentation will draw on leading practice from RSAGIM member councils in a range of areas including policy, speed reduction, and pedestrian and cyclist supporting infrastructure. It will introduce cultural approaches that support road user safety. The presentation will conclude with offering a conceptual framework for a safe system for vulnerable road users in Inner Melbourne.

TI  - The safe system approach in NSW: how are we travelling?
PY  - 2014/10
IS  - 4.4
SP  - 13p
AB  - Since 2004, the Safe System approach has been adopted across Australia as a framework for road agencies to reduce the risk of death and serious injury on our roads. In many situations, applying the principles of the Safe System approach has acted to prevent crashes or reduce the severity of the resulting outcome. However, this is an ongoing process that will take time to embed across all areas of road infrastructure management. This paper looks at real-world crash incidents where serious injury has occurred, taking place prior to the adoption of the National Road Safety Strategy in 2011. The paper considers what the prime factors were surrounding each incident. Looking at advances brought down by the Safe System approach in the past five years, the paper then considers the likelihood that these advances could have prevented each crash, or mitigated its severity. This paper will serve to highlight how the Safe System philosophy functions in real world scenarios. It should be of value to practitioners when considering how to apply the Safe System principles to their road network.

TI  - Using driver errors to inform safe system infrastructure development
PY  - 2014/10
IS  - 4.4
SP  - 12p
AB  - This Austroads project investigated the feasibility and cost of moving towards a truly Safe System infrastructure. The key feature of such an infrastructure is that it should be designed to preserve safety in the face of driver fallibility. For this reason the project began with an analysis of the actual errors that drivers make. This provided an evidence-based means of assessing how effective different types and combinations of countermeasures are in mitigating the impact of the errors that drivers make. This in turn allowed an estimate to be made of the plausibility and cost of implementing various models that can be applied as approximations to an error-tolerant system in a particular environment. Crash data derived from the in-depth crash database at the Centre for Automotive Safety Research (CASR) at the University of Adelaide was analysed to derive driver errors and create an error assessment framework. Only crashes on high speed rural roads were analysed in this project. It was found that a surprisingly small number of errors accounted for the majority of crashes, with overcorrection after straying onto the unsealed shoulder being the most common. Similarly, a relatively small number of treatment types applied in the appropriate location would have protected a large number of drivers who made errors. In the second part of the project, defined geographical areas were selected and the identified treatments systematically applied so as to model the feasibility and costs associated with providing varying levels of safety in a rural road network. The approach taken was to compare and contrast a number of models, containing various combinations of the identified treatments, to assess the performance and cost of different approximations to a fully Safe System infrastructure.

TI  - Developing an optimised safety management philosophy reflecting the Safe System in a constrained environment
PY  - 2014/05
SP  - 16p
AB  - A key feature of Safer Journeys, the New Zealand Governments guiding document for road safety over the next decade, is the introduction of the Safe System and consequent focus on reducing death and serious injury. The relatively rare nature of high severity crashes, those resulting in death or serious injury, combined with the increasing pressure on both maintenance and improvement funding has resulted in a need to reassess how safety is managed on the New Zealand State Highway Network. This paper looks at how the NZ Transport Agency has combined data and assessments from the New Zealand Road Assessment Programme (KiwiRAP), with level of service criteria, and both proactive and reactive risk assessment to determine the optimal road safety management/treatment philosophy for road corridors.

AB  - Safer Journeys, New Zealand's road safety strategy to 2020, adopted the Safe System approach. The Safe System in Practice training course was designed in 2011-12 to improve understanding of the approach, and build the skills, confidence and relationships across the sector to implement it. The course, aimed at planners, engineers, roading operations and maintenance managers, educators, enforcers, and other system designers who influence road safety, outlines the Safe System approach and principles, and best practice treatments to strengthen every element of the system. The cross-disciplinary content is developed and presented by experts and is reinforced by an action learning approach using New Zealand case studies that are worked on by small groups. In the first 18 months the course has been delivered to more than 800 people, and evaluations show it has been extremely successful. The course designers aim to train 500 more over the next year. This intensive programme gives the sector the best chance of changing the road safety conversation, and developing a shared understanding of how to reduce deaths and serious injuries, in the shortest possible time. The paper outlines the course design, results and lessons learned, with particular reference to how the course could be replicated elsewhere.

TI  - Safe System Intersection Application for Edmonton Capital Region - Pilot Project
PY  - 2014
SP  - 1 PDF file, 2.1 MB, 23p.
AB  - The Capital Region Intersection Safety Partnership (CRISP) conducted a pilot project on engineering applications of the Safe System approach. CRISP retained the Monash University Accident Research Centre (MUARC) in Melbourne, Australia to lead the project and apply the Safe System road safety philosophy to selected ‘poorly performing’ intersections in the City of Edmonton, Strathcona County and City of St. Albert (CRISP partner jurisdictions). The intent was to highlight differences between a traditional road-safety approach and a Safe System approach which might inform policy development. Safe System is a road safety philosophy believing that an individual’s safety is paramount to any other benefit which the transport network provides. Safe System does not tolerate serious injury and fatal collisions, regardless of the benefits that road users receive. This contrasts with current safety attitudes. For example in 2010 there were 2,227 fatalities and 11,226 serious injuries on Canadian roads that are accepted as a consequence of our transportation system. Despite this philosophical disparity there is evidence that attitudes are changing. MUARC’S literature review found a growing world-wide willingness to consider intersection geometries that emphasise reduced speeds or improved impact angles. Roundabouts in particular are increasingly seen as a reasonable and safer alternative to traffic signals. For this project MUARC applied their Kinetic Energy Management Model (KEMM) to sixteen problematic intersections in the Capital Region. KEMM is a conceptual model for evaluating the transfer of kinetic energy exchanged during a vehicular collision. Given vehicle impact speed and angle KEMM determines the amount of energy received by the human occupants and the likelihood that that energy will cause serious injury or death. KEMM quantified the probability of a fatal or serious injury outcome for the existing geometries of the problematic intersections as well as several alternatives. KEMM also tested the sensitivity of impact speed. The results showed which intersection geometries performed better with respect to risk, and which intersection geometries or treatments can be Safe System compliant. CRISP then sponsored a workshop for local transportation engineers to assess the feasibility of Safe System compliant treatments on the problematic intersections. There was strong interest in many of the treatments, including some innovative and previously untested treatments provided by the MUARC team. One surprising result from the workshop was the reluctance of local engineers to favour reduced speed limits or platform intersections, despite their relatively low implementation cost and strong safety benefits.

The first stage sought to identify these solutions and to establish how closely they fit the vision&rsquo;s objectives.  Following stakeholder input, the study focussed on investigations of traffic signals, roundabouts, median flexible barriers (divided and undivided roads), and roadside flexible barrier applications.  In further stages, the project is to identify areas of improvement for the selection, application and management of these solutions, so that their safety performance is brought closer to the Safe System vision.

TI  - Safe system for sustainable pedestrian safety in Bangladesh
PY  - 2013/08
SP  - 10p
AB  - This paper deals with achieving sustainable pedestrian safety in Bangladesh within the concept of safe system approach. The fact is that despite the rapid motorization level in Bangladesh, pedestrians form the largest single user group and accounted for more than half (52 percent) of the reported road traffic fatalities in Bangladesh. Detailed analysis of crash statistics revealed that around 80 percent of pedestrian accidents occurred in urban areas and rest in rural areas. Nearly 50 percent of the pedestrian fatalities occurred on road sides and 22 percent occurred while crossing the road. Children are particularly vulnerable as pedestrians. One third of the pedestrian deaths are under the age of 16 years. Heavy vehicles such as buses and heavy trucks are over involved in pedestrian injuries accompanied by the incidence of high speeding. Hazards and deficiencies associated with road infrastructure and roadside environment are major contributors to pedestrian fatalities. The iRAP infrastructure risk assessment revealed that the major highways are mostly (97 percent) 2-star or less (out of possible 5-star) for pedestrians, indicative of serious deficiencies of pedestrian facilities. Road infrastructure safety is clearly a priority and it is time for Bangladesh to quickly tighten this area for improving pedestrian safety. The relevance and the scope of introducing the new paradigm of safe system approach are briefly outlined in this paper. Some of the effective road infrastructure and speed management related countermeasures which demand priority consideration in delivering sustainable pedestrian safety are also discussed in the paper.

TI  - Incorporating the Safe System and sociodemographics into the built environment model of traffic safety: a transtheoretical model
PY  - 2013/08
SP  - 14p
AB  - In recent years, transportation engineering theory of the built environment has paid increased attention to land planning organisation and urban design in preventing traffic crashes. Empirical investigations have been conducted into the relationships between built environment factors and crash occurrence and severity. However, there is a lack of closer examination on the interactions among built environment factors and the safe system approach that is considered &lsquo;best practice&rsquo; in road safety. There is also a lack of attention to how sociodemographic factors might influence built environment factors at the micro and macro level, as well as the safe system. The objective of this research was to make explicit the multiple pathways through which the built environment potentially affects risk of crash incorporating theories of the role of sociodemographics and the safe system. A transtheoretical model is proposed developed from Ewing and Dumbaugh&rsquo;s (2009) conceptual framework linking the built environment to traffic safety to incorporate the road safety framework of the &lsquo;safe system&rsquo; components of safe roads and roadsides, safe speeds, safe road users and safe vehicles, as well as key sociodemographics based on a review of empirical research from urban planning, transport and road safety literature. A transtheoretical model is proposed to point to the importance of future efforts integrating road safety theory into built environment planning work and engineering designs.

TI  - Safe system demonstration project involving an indigenous community: implementation
SN  - 9781921991943
PY  - 2013/04
SP  - 15p
AB  - This document reports on the implementation phase of the Indigenous Safe System Demonstration Project in Bidyadanga, Western Australia.  In this phase a funding strategy was developed for the implementation plan which was prepared in the second half of 2011 and enacted during 2012.  Progress was made on the two priority issues: installing a pedestrian crossing at the main intersection; and reparation of fencing of an adjacent property to stop cattle wandering on the main highway and into the Community.  An application was also submitted, and others are planned, to fund the implementation and evaluation of safe system initiatives including: supporting infrastructure upgrades; and education campaigns to address pedestrian safety, safe speeds and safe vehicles.  This process has built capacity in the Community to identify future priorities and funding opportunities, and prepare funding applications.  Project challenges include changes in responsibility for a key road in the Community, staff turnovers and changes to funding scheme availability and applicability to the project, as well as a general lack of interest in the project at the local, state and national level.  While this project has focused on a remote Aboriginal community, the methods applied are intended to be replicable across Australia.  Working in partnership with communities, road authorities and other supporting organisations, road safety priorities can be identified and implementation and funding strategies achieved.  However, without improved cooperation between agencies on governance and sustained funding, ensuring the safe system approach to road safety extends to indigenous communities is unlikely to be realised.  National coordination is likely to be needed to ensure best practice in road safety applies in all regions of Australia.

TI  - Introduction (or Reintroduction) to the Safe System Approach
PY  - 2013/02
IS  - E-C172
SP  - pp 51-58
AB  - The Safe System approach to road safety was adopted in principle by Australian Road and Transport Ministers through the Australian Transport Council in 2004. This policy principle now underpins Australian road safety strategies in all jurisdictions in the country. The Safe System approach and its predecessors, Vision Zero and Sustainable Safety, represent a substantial shift in how road safety problems and solutions are conceived. It requires researchers and practitioners to embrace the new scientific basis for analysis and actions. And in order to achieve safety results whilst maintaining a good level of community support, an injection of funding for refitting the road infrastructure is needed. Moreover, two of the primary levers of the Safe System are forgiving roads and roadsides and speed management set to levels needed for sustaining human health. These two aspects bring significant engineering and political challenges. The Safe System approach recognizes the inherent vulnerability and fallibility of human road users and invokes active and passive mitigation strategies that encourage system self-correction on a number of fronts. It requires that these characteristics be taken into account in the design and management of the road traffic system. A Safe System approach is the only way to achieve the vision of zero road fatalities and serious injuries, as this approach means that the road system is designed to expect and accommodate human error and correct for it. It does not just build infrastructure and put in place road rules with the assumption that road users will use the road in the way that the designers intended. The challenges of the Safe System are outlined in this paper. The ability to meet these challenges will be in part determined by the level of political and managerial commitment and leadership that will be required of governments to pursue ambitious road safety objectives.

TI  - Implementing the safe system approach to road safety: some examples of infrastructure related approaches
SN  - 9789163729737
PY  - 2013
SP  - 12
AB  - The Safe System approach has been adopted by a number of global organisations as the best practice approach for delivering road safety. This approach marks a significant change in how road safety is implemented, and the outcomes sought. The Safe System approach has been adopted by a number of countries, including Australia as the guiding principle for achieving road safety outcomes. This paper presents recent examples from Australia of how the Safe System approach may be implemented, particularly in regards to road infrastructure solutions. Details are provided on several initiatives, including the development of a Safe System framework to assess whether major projects are in accord with Safe System principles; work to embed Safe System objectives into the planning process; integration between asset management and safety; updates of the Australian and New Zealand guidance documents for road design to incorporate Safe System thinking; a process for speed limit setting to meet Safe System objectives; and research to improve the performance of road infrastructure to better achieve Safe System outcomes. Case studies are provided for several of these initiatives, and a discussion of future directions provided.

TI  - Innovative intersection designs better aligning with safe system
SN  - 9789163729737
PY  - 2013
SP  - 15
AB  - In response to continuing serious injury trauma at intersections, an in-depth investigation was completed of crashes at intersections in Victoria, Australia. Adopting a “green-fields” approach, a primary goal of the investigation was to determine the fundamental design principles required to create intersection designs that are better aligned with the Safe System philosophy. A key principle identified was the need to limit side impact crash speeds to under 50 km/h, recognising that the biomechanical tolerance of the human body exceeds its threshold when exposed to speeds greater than this. Minimising angles and conflict points were also identified as important principles. The investigation generated a number of existing and new designs that incorporate these principles. This paper presents some of these designs along with a general discussion on implementation possibilities of the designs.

PY  - 2013

IS  - 2
SP  - 28-38
AB  - In accord with the UN Global Decade of Action 2011-2020, Indonesia is committed to reducing its traffic fatalities by 50 percent by the end of 2020. Traffic accidents in 2010 were officially estimated to result in an annual social cost of about 3.1 percent of the Indonesian Gross Domestic Product (GDP), rising to 3.7 percent of GDP in 2011. With rapid motorisation associated with economic development, annual social costs could approach some AUD 39 Billion or 4.6% of GDP. The Indonesian National Traffic Police Corps role is specified in law relating to road traffic and transportation and includes responsibilities for: roadpolicing, traffic management and traffic enforcement; accident investigation; accident reporting and analysis; driver licensing; vehicle registration; and traffic education. Law 22/2009 provides the legislative framework for road safety activities, but the direction is provided by the National General Plan for Traffic and Road Transportation Safety which was released in 2011. The plan identifies five pillars on which to build road safety and traffic enforcement policies and actions: road safety management; safer roads; safer vehicles; safer road users; and, post crash care. To ensure that reliable and valid accident data are available, the police have withWorld Bank funding developed a web-based accident investigation system (AIS). After piloting in Central Java during 2012, the AIS is available nationwide. Access to comprehensive, reliable and accurate road accident data makes it possible to identify the specific roads, vehicles and road users which need to be targeted with road safety and traffic enforcement interventions. Not only is the IRSMS being used as an accident investigation and policing tool, the system is able to be used by road safety stakeholders. The ability to access up-to-date accident data coupled with the need for Local, Provincial and National road safety interventions, the IRSMS will aid decision makers to develop evidence based strategies to reduce casualties and improve road safety in Indonesia.

AB  - New Zealand formally adopted the Safe System Approach in March 2010 with the Safer Journeys Road Safety Strategy to 2020. Since then we have been attempting to better understand the implications of this and how to turn strategy into action in respect to roads and roadsides activities in particular. This paper outlines our leanings to date through international advice, reviewing of relative research, modelling casualty outcomes of various safety programmes and countermeasures, development of the High Risk Rural Roads Guide (HRRRG) and High Risk Intersection Guide (HRIG), and the use of tools such as KiwiRAP (New Zealand's joint agency Road Assessment Programme), KAT and SafetyNET to inform road safety investments to create a more forgiving state highway road network, increasingly free of death and serious injury.

TI  - Towards safe system infrastructure investment on New Zealand roads: a technique for maximising serious trauma savings
PY  - 2012/10
SP  - 7p
AB  - The Macro Estimates for Target Setting (METS) modelling technique developed at MUARC has been used extensively to estimate the savings in serious casualties (fatalities and seriously injured) for road safety strategies in a number of Australian states and territories. In this application, the New Zealand Transport Authority (NZTA) sought to focus specifically on exploring opportunities for improved road safety outcomes for the nation's road infrastructure investment programs. METS was adapted to investigate several scenarios involving not only reallocating expenditure among existing programs, but also the introduction of three new &ldquo;Safe System Transformation&rdquo; programs. These programs, involving a notional amount of up to NZ$100m of investment per annum, targeted serious casualties at urban intersections, rural intersections, and head-on and run-off-road crashes on rural routes. Between 2007 and 2009, these three categories comprised half of all serious casualties on New Zealand roads. New techniques were developed, consistent with Safe System principles, for maximising serious casualty savings at intersections and along routes, using the comprehensive crash data available from the NZTA. Each of the three scenarios was predicted to prevent between 1000 and 1700 additional serious casualties compared with the "business-as-usual" case over a ten-year period. This paper illustrates the application of the optimisation process for serious run-off-road crashes on rural routes.

TI  - Exploring the application of the safe system approach to cycling
PY  - 2012/10
SP  - 11p
AB  - The safe system approach [SSA] has been recently adopted Australia wide as an approach to road safety.  However, much of its application has focussed on motor vehicle safety, and there is limited consideration in the context of cycling safety.  As a part of the Safer Cycling Study, a prospective cohort study in which a large cohort of cyclists reported on their cycling patterns and experience, all cyclists who experienced a crash were interviewed.  Interviews were structured around the four elements of the SSA: safe road use, safe infrastructure, safe speeds and safer vehicles.  These elements also formed the high-level themes of template analysis of cyclists&rsquo; perceived crash causes and opportunities for prevention.  Cyclists perceived factors associated with road use (behaviour) as being the greatest contributor to crashes, partly because of a tendency to blame themselves for crashes which could have been avoided by safer infrastructure.  Infrastructure factors were next most frequently reported as crash contributors.  Cyclists rarely reported safe vehicles or speed as contributory factors.  The majority of opportunities for prevention were also perceived to be around safe road use, and included education for all road users.   Improved signage and lighting on existing infrastructure and extension of cyclist infrastructure were also mentioned frequently. Consideration of the four quadrants of the SSA provides a useful framework for improving research, policy and practice relating to cycling safety.  Although cyclists may lack specific expertise, their perceptions of crash causation and opportunities for prevention offer specific avenues for creating a safer cycling system.

TI  - Combining safe system principles and road safety education in schools: an opportunity for improved demand on road system operators and a broader understanding of risk and safety
PY  - 2012/10
SP  - 6p
AB  - Road safety education in schools offers many opportunities for improving road safety.  The present paper draws on evidence of successful learning of road safety messages (as shown in school leaver quizzes) and safe system principles, to recommend features of road safety education which increase its chances of success.  Safe system principles herald a new road safety paradigm in which the system operators hold the major responsibility for road safety, with an onus to accept that people will make mistakes, and thus that crashes will occur; and an onus to provide a system in which people are not exposed to physical forces beyond those which the human body can withstand, in a crash.  Road safety education has not yet adopted this paradigm.  Evidence based practice supports the following features of road safety education: it is part of the school curriculum, rather than irregular events; it includes content for every year of school; it does not include driver training; it is taught by professional school teachers with extra training in road safety so as not to perpetuate the social myths and risk misjudgements which pervade road safety; it includes teaching safe system principles as well as personal responsibility, in order to create understanding and demand for a safer system, the ultimate solution to the road safety problem.

TI  - A safe system based approach to selection of clear zones, safety barriers and other roadside treatments
PY  - 2012/10
SP  - 11p
AB  - On average, 560 fatal run-off-road crashes occur annually in Australia and 135 in New Zealand.  In addition, there are more than 14,000 run-off-road crashes causing injuries each year across both countries.  In rural areas, run-off-road casualty crashes constitute 50-60 per cent of all casualty crashes.  Their severity is particularly high with more than half of those involved sustaining fatal or serious injuries.  This paper reviews the existing approach to roadside hazard risk assessment, selection of clear zones and hazard treatments.  It proposes a modified approach to roadside safety evaluation and management. It is a methodology based on statistical modelling of run-off-road casualty crashes, and application of locally developed crash modification factors and severity indices.  Clear zones, safety barriers and other roadside design/treatment options are evaluated with a view to minimise fatal and serious injuries - the key safe system objective.  The paper concludes with a practical demonstration of the proposed approach.  The paper is based on findings from a four-year Austroads research project into improving roadside safety in the safe system context.

TI  - Working together for a safe system: provision of relevant resources for Western Australian local governments
PY  - 2012/09
SP  - 9p
AB  - The Local Government Safe System Project was established in May 2009 by the Western Australian Local Government Association (WALGA). The first phase of the project focused on raising awareness and understanding of the safe system approach within Local Government; clarifying the current level of capacity of Local Governments to adopt a safe system approach; and identifying the barriers and opportunities for Local Governments to move towards this approach. The second phase has focused on the development of resources to assist Local Governments to adopt and embed the safe system approach into Local Government strategies and operations. It builds on the comprehensive work undertaken in the first phase, which found the Local Government sector understands the importance of road safety and their role in preventing crashes. The three key resources developed to assist Local Governments in the implementation of a safe system are: The Safe System Guiding Principles for Local Government, the Local Government Safe System Improvement Program and the Safe System Toolkit for Local Government. This paper will consider the progress towards the road safety goal and targets set for the second phase of the Local Government Safe System Project, including an overview of the key resources developed so far.

TI  - The 'Yalgoo experience': applying the safe system approach in a remote setting
PY  - 2012/09
SP  - 8p
AB  - In Western Australia, 7,876 serious crashes were recorded in rural areas between 1995 and 2004. Of the 7,876 serious crashes recorded, 22 serious injury crashes were recorded in the Shire of Yalgoo including four fatalities. The Shire of Yalgoo is located approximately 524 km north-east of Perth, has a population of 242 and is classified as a remote area in terms of road safety. This paper investigates the implementation of the safe system approach to road safety in a remote setting and outlines the partnerships that have been developed to create a shared responsibility for road safety within the community and other key stakeholders. The paper will focus upon a meeting of relevant stakeholders and community members from Yalgoo that occurred to address a specific issue of pedestrian safety on the Geraldton Mount Magnet road. The OLA process was used to address the issues surrounding pedestrian safety which provided a proactive and coordinated approach to resolving the issue. Under the OLA approach all parties are encouraged to provide objective data from their area of expertise, jointly work as a team to list the opportunities to overcome the concern, and then develop an action, responsibilities and timeline plan and implement to deliver the required road safety outcomes. The paper will outline the benefits of such an approach in achieving desired outcomes in relation to this issue and other similar issues facing local governments with road safety issues around Western Australia.

TI  - Techniques for paradigm improvements: towards a heavy vehicle safe system
PY  - 2012/08
SP  - 10p
AB  - Enhanced driver education, trip time insurance, log book revisions, low interest loans and accelerated depreciation allowance are paramount issues which could yield paradigm improvements towards a safer system for heavy vehicle (HV) operation.  In addition a 24/7 independently funded driver contact centre should be created to receive and address driver problems and issues.  Enhanced driver education is necessary to inform heavy vehicle drivers of the near chaotic multiple scenario handling behaviour of unimproved air suspended vehicles.  To this end a DVD based driver education resource is suggested.  Next a scheme for operators to insure against journey delays will be outlined.  The essential aim of this scheme is to encourage heavy vehicle drivers operate at speeds commensurate with actual road conditions and avoid attempting to compensate, for delays, by speeding.  Next it is proposed that during extended traffic delays HV drivers should be encouraged and/or allowed to park on road shoulders or in nearside lanes to attract log book recordable rest periods.  Finally it is proposed that the cost incurred by HV operators installing genuine vehicle safety enhancements attract liberal accelerated depreciation allowance.  Opportunity is taken to present brief paramount details of each proposed strategy.

TI  - Working together for a safe system: progress of the resources developed for WA local governments
PY  - 2012/08
SP  - 11p
AB  - The Western Australian Local Government Association established the Local Government Safe System Project (LGSSP) in May 2009.  The project goal is to increase the uptake of safe system principles by local government, in a shared responsibility approach, for the implementation of Towards Zero: Western Australia&rsquo;s road safety strategy 2008-2020.  Phase one of the project focused on raising awareness and understanding of the safe system approach among local governments; clarifying the current level of capacity of local governments to adopt a safe system approach; and identifying the barriers and opportunities for local governments to move towards this approach.  The first phase provided a clear picture of a local government sector that understands the importance of road safety and their role in preventing crashes.  However, additional support was recognised by the sector for the move into adoption and implementation of a safe system.  Therefore, phase two has concentrated on the adoption and implementation of a safe system approach into local government strategies and operations.  Phase two provided relevant support and resources to local governments to enable the progression towards a safe system.  Based on local government requests, three key safe system implementation resources have been developed, which are: 1. Guiding document: Safe System Guiding Principles for local government 2. Framework for action: local government Safe System Improvement Program 3. How to guide: Safe System Toolkit for local government.  This paper will reflect on the progress made so far of the resources specifically developed for local governments, for the implementation of the safe system approach to road safety.

TI  - Exploring an application of the safe system approach to a set of self-reported cycling crashes
PY  - 2012/08
SP  - 14p
AB  - Vulnerable road users are over-represented in traffic injuries and fatalities.  Police reports and hospitalisation data grossly underestimate bicycle crashes, and data on causation are limited.  In Australia, the safe system approach (SSA) has been adopted for motor vehicles and is an important paradigm for road safety.  However, the SSA does not appear to have been explicitly applied in policy documents that address cycling safety.  We undertook a thematic analysis of cyclists&rsquo; perceived causes of sustained collisions or falls as reported in 145 interviews with participants of the Safer Cycling Study. The interview was structured around the four key areas of the SSA.  Qualitative data analysis indicates that cyclists perceived behaviour (road use factors) as being the greatest contributor to crashes, followed by infrastructure (road and roadside factors).  Cyclists rarely reported vehicle factors or speed as contributory factors.  Consideration of the four key areas of the SSA provides a useful framework for analysing cyclists&rsquo; self-reported crash causation and may assist in the identification of crash countermeasures.

AB  - Vision Zero is an aspiration to have no fatalities or non-recoverable injuries related to road travel.  Safe system is a set of principles intended to ensure that no road user is subject to impact forces in a traffic collision from which they cannot make a complete recovery.  The ACT has adopted Vision Zero as a long-term goal for its road system and Safe System as the guiding principles through which it can be achieved.  Most road authorities, including Roads ACT, have yet to come to grips with applying safe system principles in everyday practice.  The project set out with the aim of assisting bodies in the ACT to start introducing safe system into everyday practice by getting work groups to develop their own to a plan for the application of safe system to their practice.

TI  - Safe system demonstration project in a remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community
PY  - 2011/11
SP  - 10p
AB  - This paper reports on key findings and recommendations of the first known application of a comprehensive safe system audit in a remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community; commissioned by the Indigenous Road Safety Working Group with funding from Austroads. The audit was conducted in Bidyadanga WA in collaboration with the Bidyadanga Community Council during June-August 2010, including: review of policy, management and police records; physical observation of roads, speeds and vehicles; and interviews with community members and local stakeholders including regarding road user issues and vehicle access. Bidyadanga was found to have high quality roads and safe speeds within residential areas, with limited need for upgrades and new work; however, several issues were identified on roads to access the nearest town, including a high crash “blackspot” location. Access to safe vehicles was limited. Unlicensed driving, lack of child restraints, drink driving and fatigue were key road user concerns. Needs for across-government improvements in policy and management were identified. Cost effective actions were identified. This project demonstrated that application of the safe system was feasible in a remote Aboriginal community, while lessons learned can be adapted and applied nationally to improve Aboriginal road safety.

The first phase of the project focused on raising awareness and understanding of the safe system approach within local government; clarifying the current level of capacity of local governments to adopt a safe system approach; identifying the barriers and enablers for local governments to move towards this approach; and developing a set of safe system principles to provide relevant guidance for local governments. These strategies were designed to achieve the targets set for Phase One, which were to: Increase the awareness of the Towards Zero strategy within local governments by 10 per cent by May 2011; Increase the knowledge of the safe system approach within local government by 10 per cent by May 2011; Increase the adoption of the safe system approach into local government strategies, plans and policies by 5 per cent by May 2011. This paper will consider the outcomes of the first phase of the Local Government Safe System Project, and measure the progress towards the goal and targets of the project. Key learnings from Phase One will be explored, and the way forward for Phase Two of the project will be outlined.

TI  - Measuring the influence of the road and roadside in the safe system
PY  - 2011/11
SP  - 11p
AB  - The Australian Road Safety Strategy (2011-2020) recognises safe roads and safe speeds to be two cornerstones of the Safe System approach with great potential to reduce casualties. Aims of the strategy include assessing risk on the road network in order to target high risk sections and locations, and setting speed limits according to the risk and function of the road and roadside environment. Central to achieving these aims is the measurement of the influence of the road and road environment on crash risk. Previous research, both in Australia and overseas, has focused mainly on relatively simple road environments (e.g. highways and rural roads) while urban environments have been somewhat neglected. This is likely due to the difficulty in obtaining the data to fully characterise such complex environments. To achieve the aims of the strategy, a more systematic approach is needed to develop risk assessment models for all roads in the road network. The first step is collecting the necessary data. This paper will discuss the data requirements necessary for developing risk assessment models of the relationship between the design of the road and roadside environment and crash risk for any type of road. Other uses for such data will also be considered, e.g. asset management and other public health and safety-related research and reporting.

TI  - Rationalisation of speed limits within the safe system approach
PY  - 2011/11
SP  - 11p
AB  - This paper summarises the calculation of the optimum speeds for the range of Australian rural road types: rural freeways, multi-lane divided roads, and single-lane undivided roads, with and without shoulder-sealing. The system-wide impacts if cars and trucks were to travel at their optimum speeds, as a basis for setting speed limits in each road environment, are then calculated. A rationalisation of speed limits to reflect the innate expectations of drivers, but also based on rational analysis of all the costs and benefits, may result in greater compliance with speed limits and make intensive speed enforcement more palatable and even unnecessary long-term.

TI  - Risk-based approach to speed limits: a step towards Safe System
PY  - 2011/09
SP  - 17p
AB  - Safer speeds are recognised as an integral tool in reducing road trauma, also they are a key pillar of the Safe System philosophy. The current national guidance on speed limits recognises this at the conceptual level but the approach for practical implementation has not been developed to date. This paper aims to stimulate discussion around the emerging concept of setting speed limits on basis of severe crash risk (fatal and serious injury outcomes). It draws on recent Austroads research to propose several alternative approaches based on crash history, assessment of inherent crash risk due to the road environment, or both. The presented approaches also recognise the intended road function within the network as an indicator of the mobility level expected by the public. The paper explores the possible application of established network-level risk assessment tools such as AusRAP in risk-based approach to speed limits.

TI  - Safe system infrastructure: from theory to practice
PY  - 2011/09
SP  - 8p
AB  - The safe system has now been a key concept in Victoria's road safety strategy for a number of years. There is now a growing amount of infrastructure in Victoria which is consistent with the Safe System philosophy of designing the road system to be more forgiving of human error and attempting to manage crash forces to survivable levels. The infrastructure includes such things as wire rope safety barriers and roundabouts and the speed limits school and strip shopping centre speed zones. Work has been undertaken to reach an understanding of what a Safe System philosophy means in practice. This thinking is now being utilised in road safety project designs and considered as part of broader policy decisions such as road safety performance measures for major projects. However, there are still major challenges to overcome before the full potential of the Safe System concept is realised. These challenges include a shared understanding of what Safe System means in practice, the requirement for a significant change process to redevelop processes and standards and the high capital and maintenance costs of some Safe System infrastructure treatments.

TI  - Increasing safe system awareness in Queensland road authorities
PY  - 2011/09
SP  - 10p
AB  - In Queensland the safe system framework first appeared in the Queensland Road Safety Action Plan 2008-2009. In mid 2009 it was recognised that there had been no specific communication strategy targeting the engineering community in Queensland. As a result, two approaches were adopted to improve knowledge and awareness. The Safer Roads Technical Update publication contains news and articles on road safety, predominantly safe roads and safe speeds. It covers innovative treatments, research findings from Australia and worldwide, road safety data analysis and road safety success stories. Some editions focus on a particular topic, such as speed, vulnerable road users, or the Safe System. Also one day workshops were delivered in thirteen regional centres around the state in 2010. They were designed to inform regional and council engineers and technicians of the practical steps they could take to contribute towards achieving a safer road system and reducing road trauma. They included interactive sessions as well as presentations. The Technical Update has increased the knowledge and the profile of road safety issues across the engineering community within the Department of Transport and Main Roads (TMR) and local councils. An outcomes report identified areas of concern in delivering road safety at the regional and local levels and potential areas of improvement to enhance future road safety outcomes. DE Road safety

AB  - A safe system road can be achieved by matching the speed limit to the infrastructure or vice versa. The idea of reducing the speed limit, at locations where the road environment changes, is not a new concept. For decades, when the road environment changed (ie. water over the road, rough surfaces, road events or roadworks), Victoria has reduced speed limits to mitigate safety risks. As we move forward, and with the increased understanding of the human tolerances to physical forces, will reducing speed limits at locations that do not meet safe system speeds be as acceptable? Victoria's current speed zoning guidelines identify the need to manage vehicle speeds to balance society's desire for mobility with its need for safety, but also acknowledge the safe system as a basis for implementing speed management. The guidelines take significant steps towards achieving a safe system. The recent inclusion of school speed zones and strip shopping centre speed zones show a commitment to the progression towards a safe system. With limited funding available for infrastructure improvements to the road network, this paper discusses the issues associated with a speed limit policy that would achieve a true safe system.

TI  - Implementing safe system research in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities
PY  - 2011/09
SP  - 5p
AB  - Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians are at increased risk of death and serious injury due to road crashes than other Australians. The safe system road safety approach aligns well with Aboriginal holistic knowledge and worldviews, yet little information is available on applications to Aboriginal settings. This paper reports on a safe system demonstration project in an Aboriginal community, commissioned by the Indigenous Road Safety Working Group, funded by Austroads, who formed the Reference Group for the study. Ethical approval was obtained and the project was advertised nationally calling for expressions of interest. Several applications were received and a community selected in conjunction with the Reference Group: Bidyadanga WA. Further consultation with the Bidyadanga Community Council resulted in unanimous support for the project and commitment to undertake a collaborative role. The audit was successfully conducted during June-August 2010. This demonstration project showed application of the safe system to Aboriginal settings is feasible. Strong engagement with the community was essential. The approach undertaken provides a model for other Indigenous communities both in Australia and internationally.

TI  - Classifying safe system fatalities: an examination of Victorian road fatalities in relation to components of the safe system
PY  - 2011/09
SP  - 11p
AB  - The safe system, if properly and fully applied, should see the near elimination of deaths and permanently disabling injuries from road crashes. As Victoria's road safety agencies increasingly adopt and apply safe system principles, it becomes important to be able to measure and report on progress of safe system implementation and coverage. Application of the safe system principles requires action in three areas: road users, particularly in relation to access to the road network and adherence to road rules; vehicles, in relation to crashworthiness and crash avoidance; and roads and roadsides with associated speed limits. It is important to measure the effectiveness of the application of the safe system principles within these three areas. The TAC created a framework for classifying fatality crashes according to the presence or absence of each of the three elements of the safe system. Subsequently, the TAC appraised 578 fatality crashes that occurred during 2009 and 2010 and evaluated them within this classification framework. Information including vehicle safety ratings and road user compliance with certain road rules such as restraint wearing was recorded. An assessment was made of the environment and infrastructure involved in the crash, for example, the presence of run-off-road protection and posted speed limits. This paper describes the classification framework and the application of the framework to police reported fatalities. It then presents some key metrics arising from analysis of the compiled data and highlights challenges to the realisation of the safe system.

TI  - Safe system: comparisons of this approach in Australia
PY  - 2011/09
SP  - 16p
AB  - The concept of the safe system approach evolves from the Vision Zero and Sustainable Safety concepts that were introduced in the mid-1990s. In preparation for a truly safe system strategy for road safety in Australia, it is instructive to learn from the achievements and shortcomings of this type of approach. This paper examines the experience of Safe System approaches in Victoria, Western Australia and New South Wales thus far. Each of these cases has interpreted the Safe System approach differently. The question is, do these differences in approach affect safety outcomes? In addition, do these cases provide evidence of the effectiveness of the Safe System approach? While Safe System principles have underpinned some road safety projects in Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales it is difficult to definitively attribute overall road safety gains in these jurisdictions to the adoption of this principle. The primary levers of the Safe System approach are forgiving roads/roadsides, crashworthy vehicles and speed management to levels needed for sustaining human health. These aspects bring significant engineering and political challenges.

TI  - Motorcycling and the safe system: an international perspective
PY  - 2011/09
SP  - 8p
AB  - Motorcycling represents a significant and growing proportion of road trauma across the world. While Safe System approaches have the potential to produce significant reductions in trauma across the road system, the challenges of applying these to motorcycling are likely to be greater. If these challenges are not met, motorcycling will become an increasing obstacle to the achievement of a safe system for all road users and widespread reduction in road trauma. While some of these challenges are technical and the result of the physical limitations of the mode, the community's acceptance of risk is also fundamental to the progress that can be made. This paper examines how different jurisdictions set strategic direction for motorcycles within their road safety strategies or, conversely, address safety within their broader motorcycle plans. The paper also discusses whether the relative contributions of individual safe system components may need to be altered for different road user types, such as motorcyclists. Examination of the application of the Safe System to motorcycling can provide guidance in the broader issue of the role of community acceptance of risk and its impact on how quickly transition to the Safe System can be achieved.

The Taskforce has identified a range of opportunities to improve road safety in the greater Darwin area, with particular attention to heavy vehicle traffic, and made recommendations to achieve that goal in this report.  The recommendations provide comprehensive short, medium and long term strategies.  These strategies have been based on an understanding of the growth and development likely to impact on heavy vehicle traffic in the greater Darwin area.  The Taskforce believes that continued industry and community involvement in the management of heavy vehicles on our roads, and their interaction with other traffic, is an important element in providing community safety.

An accompanying report Literature Review and Methods presents the literature review and methodology components of Part A and Part B.  The literature review proved successful in informing the development of culturally appropriate methods that resulted in identifying a demonstration community that unanimously welcomed the project– the Bidyadanga Community in Western Australia.  The literature review identified the need to work together with the successful community both to conduct the audit and develop an implementation plan.  These next stages were therefore undertaken collaboratively with the Bidyadanga Community and therefore the results are presented in this report, Audit and Implementation Plan, co-authored by the Community CEO and Council Chair, Mr Peter Yip.

In essence, looking &ldquo;outside the square&rdquo;, brainstorming design ideas clear of any real or imposed restrictions.  To be true to the Task 5 aim of considering all new design possibilities unrestricted, designs ranged from the obvious (physical barriers to prevent crashes), to the creative (cut through roundabouts) to the more ambitious (grade-separated roundabouts) and non-conventional (reverse roundabouts).

TI  - Understanding driving culture: safe system and the ACT: a report on a systematic literature review and research scoping project
PY  - 2010/09
SP  - 9p
AB  - Working toward a "safe system" goal not only requires a commitment from government but also from the larger community to adopt a culture and pattern of behaviours that minimise the likelihood of traffic crashes.  It has been assumed in some literature that if this is to be achieved, community attitudes towards road safety also need to support safe road use behaviours.  However, to date, little research has directly explored the elements of road use culture and related policy considerations that may influence community adoption of such initiatives.  The aim of this study was to firstly conduct a systematic review of relevant literature then conduct a preliminary scope of the views of key informants regarding the road culture of the ACT, and the factors perceived to affect it.  This information will provide a foundation upon which to build a longer-term, more in-depth investigation of the relevant factors underpinning road culture that could yield information regarding the best ways to implement and achieve a "safe system"- type approach.  This aim was pursued through semi-structured interviews with 11 representatives from key road use entities in the ACT and a comprehensive literature review.  Interviewees raised the possibility of a "culture of entitlement" among a variety of subcultures of ACT road users.  This paper will discuss the future approach to the exploration of this culture and subcultures.  In particular, the planned research will examine how people's attitudes towards their vehicle, the road, car ownership and driving are related to their road use behaviours and responses to road safety initiatives.

TI  - Non-motor vehicle related pedestrian injury on and near the road: implications for the safe system approach to road safety
PY  - 2010/09
SP  - 12p
AB  - Research carried out from 2008 to 2010 examined the quantum and causes of non-motor vehicle injuries to pedestrians, on or near the roadway, through a structured interview survey.  Under a safe system approach these injuries are the responsibility of the road controlling authority.  The highest proportion of trips and falls (34 per cent) were sustained while stepping over a kerb.  Factors which amplified the severity of injuries included the road or path surface, pedestrians' inattention, type of footwear worn, and whether walking or running.  Two main issues were identified from the study. These were that: 1. people tripped and fell more often on poorly-maintained surfaces as opposed to poorly-designed areas; and 2. the severity of the injuries is directly related to the surface.  The study recommends improving the definition of kerbing in key pedestrian areas and improving the maintenance regime of footpaths and roads used by pedestrians, including crossing points.  It also recommends making areas used by pedestrians more predictable in design.  The study also found that there is a need to instigate research to provide improved data and analysis tools to allow authorities to prioritise such countermeasures vis-à-vis other uses of road safety funds, and for improved data for input into such analysis tools.

AB  - Fundamental to the effective translation of safe system knowledge into action is the existence of underlying data systems consistent with this approach.  Important functions of a data system include permitting assessment of the extent to which the safe system has been applied across the road system, allowing for monitoring of the progress of road safety strategies created under the system and assisting road safety managers in developing future policy in accordance with safe system principles.  This paper outlines conceptual frameworks defining an ideal data system based fully on the safe system approach.  It then presents an examination of two Australian jurisdictions, namely Western Australia and Victoria, the current status of the data systems in each state and how these compare with the ideal system, and discusses the potential of improved data systems to enhance the translation of safe system knowledge into practice.

AB  - The Safe System approach has been adopted by all Australian jurisdictions as the guiding principle for delivering road safety outcomes and a guiding framework has been included in the National Road Safety Action Plan since 2005-2006.  Despite this, the understanding of the Safe System approach and the application of it by local government to the local road network is low.  A workshop, facilitated by ARRB Group and WALGA, was held at the conclusion of the 2010 Australasian Road Safety Research, Policing and Education Conference held at the National Convention Centre in Canberra, ACT.  This Research Report has been prepared to collate the material presented at the workshop and to summarize the discussion and contributions of the participants so others in local government or agencies who deal and work with local government can gain an appreciation of the Safe System approach and issues for local government road safety initiatives and action.

AB  - This paper proposes a set of new principles for setting speed limits based on harm minimisation, the cornerstone of the Safe System approach.  The Safe System approach seeks to develop and manage the road transport system  so that death and serious injury are eliminated.  Safer Roads and Safer Speeds are two of its main elements.  The new speed limit setting principles have been developed for Austroads by the Australian Road Research Board  (ARRB) and road jurisdiction stakeholders.  As part of the new principles, a process is proposed to analyse the Safe System readiness of a road and identify the speed limit options and road improvement options required to achieve safe travel.  It is recognised, however, that in the short and medium term, many of the Safe System road features may not be economically viable and not all speed limits would be immediately acceptable to the public.  Thus, various harm reduction measures are proposed as interim steps towards the Safe System. (a)

SN  - 9789163363597
PY  - 2010/03
SP  - 124-32
AB  - The safe system approach has recently been adopted by Australia as the guiding principle for delivering road safety outcomes.  This approach suggests (amongst other things) road users will make mistakes, and that they have a limited tolerance for surviving such events, or avoiding serious injury.  Therefore, there is a need for a road system that is ‘forgiving’ of mistakes by road users.  There is also a need to manage road users to ensure that they are alert and compliant.  Although the vision for this approach is clear, the actions that might be taken to achieve it are less obvious.  This paper presents details of the safe system approach, including the road safety context in Australia, and details of the safe system approach as adopted.  It also summarises current thinking in Australia on specific aspects of this approach, including speed management within a safe system context; the role of infrastructure in delivering safe system outcomes, and the role of road users in this system.  Each of these issues is discussed based on recent Australian experience.

AB  - The Safe System approach has now been adopted by each jurisdiction within Australia, and is likely to be at the core of the new national road safety strategy.  Based primarily on the Swedish 'Vision Zero', and the Dutch 'Sustainable Safety' approaches, the Safe System approach recognises that humans as road users are fallible and will make mistakes.  There are also limits to the kinetic energy exchange which humans can tolerate (e.g. during the rapid deceleration associated with a crash) before serious injury or death occurs.  A key part of the Safe System approach requires that infrastructure be designed and managed to take account of these errors and vulnerabilities so that road users are able to avoid serious injury or death on the road.  Although the Safe System vision is clear within Australia, and there is general agreement about this, the approaches that might be taken to achieve this vision are less obvious.  Advice is required regarding infrastructure options for achieving Safe System outcomes; on appropriate speed management strategies; and on ways to maximise the alertness and compliance of road users.  In order to help understand how jurisdictions can meet these objectives, ARRB has facilitated a series of national workshops to discuss these issues.

TI  - Australia's new approach to road safety: how is the safe system approach bien implemented?
PY  - 2010
SP  - s 124-132
AB  - The Safe System approach has recently been adopted by Australia as the guiding principle for delivering road safety outcomes. This approach suggests (amongst other things) road users will make mistakes, and that they have a limited tolerance for surviving such events, or avoiding serious injury. Therefore, there is a need for a road system that is 'forgiving' of mistakes by road users. There is also a need to manage road users to ensure that they are alert and compliant.Although the vision for this approach is clear, the actions that might be taken to achieve it are less obvious. This paper presents details of the Safe System approach, including the road safety context in Australia, and  details of the Safe System approach as adopted. It also summarises current thinking in Australia on specific aspects of this approach, including speed management within a Safe System context; the role of infrastructure in delivering Safe System outcomes, and the role of road users in this system. Each  of these issues is discussed based on recent Australian experience.

TI  - Road lighting for safety: a forward-looking, safe system-based review
SN  - 9781921692260
PY  - 2009/11
SP  - 11p
AB  - Road lighting for traffic is primarily a safety measure.  The literature generally ascribes some level of crash reduction to improved road lighting but papers seldom specify whether lighting existed before the change, or its level where it did exist.  One is left to assume that, at least after the change, the lighting satisfied the standards of the appropriate road controlling authority.  These standards vary considerably worldwide and are based on practitioner consensus.  This is because few data have been available to link safety to the actual standard of lighting.  This means that any dose-response relationship lacks clarity.  Locally, this situation is compounded in that both Australia and New Zealand have little history of measuring the reflective properties of pavements.  Both countries' standards are based on measurements carried out decades ago.  With this in mind the New Zealand Transport Agency contracted Opus Central Laboratories to carry out on-site measurements of the reflective properties of a sample of New Zealand pavements.  The results indicate that New Zealand pavements, lit for safety purposes, are considerably less reflective, and thus the roads are less safe than previously thought.  The literature indicates that this may be more than just a localised problem for New Zealand.  Using a forward looking approach, this paper discusses the safety aspects of lighting within a safe system framework, and draws conclusions in the light of the literature and the aforementioned work carried out in New Zealand.

TI  - Incorporating Safe System in learner driver handbooks
SN  - 9781921692260
PY  - 2009/11
SP  - 13p
AB  - Safe System has been adopted as the guiding principle by all State and Territory road authorities in Australia.  The essential goal is to provide a road system in which the road users will never be subject to impact forces in a collision from which they may never recover completely.  No road authority has yet communicated the Safe System principles directly to road users.  This project tested the viability of introducing Safe System concepts to young drivers in the ACT Road Rules Handbook.  Messages related to the Safe System concept were developed.  Topics were guided by a comparison of the Safe System principles with safety messages that already existed in the Handbook and the judgments of an expert panel.  Message content was informed by an established theory of persuasion and knowledge of motivational factors behind risky driving behaviours.  The messages were tested on two focus groups (learner and provisional licence holders aged 16 to 20 years).  The Safe System concept was well-received by focus group participants who liked its simplicity and appreciated that their role and responsibilities were immediately clear.  Designing Safe System messages for drivers is viable.  The concept is worth developing further.

AB  - This paper presents an approach to setting speed limits based on harm minimisation.  The paper is based on the outcomes of a recent Austroads project conducted by ARRB reviewing the principles for setting speed limits in the context of Safe System, beyond the horizon of current guidelines.  The project examined the relationships between road infrastructure, driver speeds, speed limits and crash outcomes through extensive literature review and data analysis.  The role of road infrastructure features in speed limit setting was then evaluated by an Austroads panel of speed management policy stakeholders.  The process resulted in advice on appropriate speed limit setting policy and principles in the Safe System context.  The project also identified possible intermediate speed management policy options on the path towards the Safe System.

PY  - 2009/11
SP  - 6P
AB  - The safe system approach to road safety has renewed the focus on the need  for an informed and engaged community to contribute to the adoption and application of effective road safety strategies.  Community road safety programs play an important role in generating the community support, partnerships and engagement in road safety that is recognised as an integral role  in achieving a safe system.  However traditional evaluation efforts, which have focused primarily on delivery and processes, do not provide a complete picture of the contribution of community road safety programs in this  new framework.  It is timely to explore new areas of evaluation measurement, such as social capital, which can make an additional contribution to the evaluation picture for community road safety.

TI  - Achieving road safety targets under the safe system
PY  - 2009/09
SP  - 12P (SESSION TUES 2D)
AB  - Since the mid-1990s several jurisdictions have implemented the safe system approach to road safety while setting ambitious targets for reduction in  the road toll.  More recently the principles of this system have been applied in Australia and are also being considered in New Zealand.  This approach acknowledges that the limits to human performance mean that road user error is inevitable.  Given that driver error will occur it is vital to reduce the seriousness of the consequences.  There is considerable flexibility in the interpretation of the safe system approach suggesting that the  details are of importance to the effectiveness of the approach.  Setting  priorities for interventions after taking into account the behavioural response to these changes will maximise the effectiveness.  Implementation of this approach to achieve reduction in the road toll requires ongoing effort.  It is also proposed that a broad conception of the system approach to crash causation, one which accounts for social and institutional values, should be encouraged and promoted across the many agencies involved with  implementation.

TI  - Exploring how the safe system concept might change the way people are introduced to driving
PY  - 2009/07
SP  - 50p
AB  - The primary objective of this project is to test the viability of introducing Safe System concepts to drivers at an early stage in the learning process.  No licensing authority has yet attempted to communicate the principles of Safe System directly to drivers.  By introducing the concept in an easy to understand manner in the ACT Road Rules Handbook, driver understanding of their role in road safety should be improved.  The benefits, should the recommendations of this report be implemented, might include priming road users for attitude and behaviour change.  This project involved: 1. Review of the Handbook: an initial review of the ACT Road Rules Handbook to identify areas where the Safe System message could be overlayed. 2. Development of messages: production of proposed new content based on the Safe System philosophy and grounded in established theory of persuasion. 3. Review by expert panel: an expert panel to review and provide suggestions for improvement of the proposed new content.  Revisions were made to the messages to incorporate the suggestions of this review before presentation to the focus groups. 4. Critique by focus groups: two focus groups to provide young driver opinions and ideas about the style and content of the messages.  Final revisions were made to incorporate this critique.

PY  - 2009/06

AB  - The World Report on Road Traffic Injury Prevention, jointly issued on World Health Day 2004 by the World Health Organization and the World Bank, highlights the growing public health burden of road deaths and makes a powerful case for urgent measures to address the problem as a global development priority.  Efficient and effective implementation of the World Report's recommendations will require countries working in partnership with the international development community to scale up, refocus and harmonize their road safety activities, with an emphasis on managing for results.  These guidelines provide a framework to direct such actions and are a revised and expanded version of the World Bank Transport Note TN1, Implementing the Recommendations of the World Report on Road Traffic Injury Prevention, which was first issued in April 2004.  The guidelines promote a Safe System approach to road safety and have been produced for use in any country irrespective of its development status or road safety performance.  They draw on the World Report findings and provide a management framework to guide the implementation of its recommendations.  Further updates are planned, based on the experience gained with their application in low, middle and high-income countries.

TI  - The &lsquo;safe system&rsquo; approach to level crossing safety
PY  - 2009
SP  - 9p.
AB  - This paper calls for the preparation, long-term funding and implementation of national, state and territory level crossing strategy plans based on the &lsquo;Safe System&rsquo; approach to road safety. The strategies would draw on and apply all the available safety measures to improve safety at level crossings. Developed in Europe, the &lsquo;Safe System&rsquo; emphasises the responsibility of system designers for the design, operation and use of the road system. The users of the system are responsible for following the rules set by the designers. However, if the users fail to comply with the rules due to a lack of knowledge, acceptance or ability, the system designers are required to take further steps to prevent people from being killed or injured. The &lsquo;Safe System&rsquo; approach is one of many initiatives the rail industry can and are now learning from road safety experts, including advances made in Intelligent Transport Systems. On-going discussion between rail and road safety experts needs to be encouraged and facilitated by governments. Greater research into level crossing safety needs to be undertaken, with early priorities the development of a comprehensive crash data base and the trialling of appropriate low-cost warning and Intelligent Transport Systems. Laws and standards need to be revised to accommodate the use of new warning technologies, in particular to address the use, in appropriate circumstances, of non fail-safe systems. Unnecessary, surplus crossings, especially those on highways and arterial roads, should be closed, and road speed limits on crossing approach roads, reduced to 80 km/h. Above all else, a revolution in attitudes to level crossing safety is required. The transport industry needs an energetic champion to drive reforms, and that champion will need to be supported by organised and committed stakeholders.

PY  - 2009
SP  - 329p
AB  - Following the publication of the World Health Organisation's 'World Report on Road Traffic Injury Prevention' in 2004, this document presents guidelines to help low- and middle-income countries develop measures to reduce the economic and social costs associated with road accidents.  The guidelines promote a 'Safe System' approach to road safety which can be applied to any country but are particularly related here to low- and middle-income countries.  The six main World Report recommendations, which identified the strategic initiatives necessary to improve country road safety performance, are first set out.     It is suggested that in order to implement the recommendations, capacity building at the global, regional and country levels is required to create the resources and tools necessary.  At the country level institutional management functions are considered to be particularly important with a focus on results.  The conduct of a safety management capacity review is  seen as a necessary first step and procedures for carrying this out are outlined.  From the capacity review the development of a long-term investment strategy, Safe System projects and lead agency strengthening are then described.  Detailed case studies from countries with examples of good practice (New Zealand, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden and the two Australian states of Victoria and Western Australia) and from transitional countries (Malaysia and Poland) are presented in annexes.

TI  - A Safe System Approach to Traffic Safety
PY  - 2008
SP  - 5p
AB  - Fatal crash outcomes usually depend upon a number of factors which interact and lead to death. We need to consider the role that all the elements play in a fatal outcome – the road and roadside, the vehicle, the speed limit and behaviour of the road users involved. A logical framework, which examines these road safety elements and their interactions is essential to enable practitioners to develop their thinking and understanding around risk and countermeasure possibilities. It also assists in providing more readily understood explanations of road safety risks and their potential treatment to the wider community. As road users are human, crashes are always likely to happen even though there is a continuing focus on prevention. The safe system approach recognises that there are limits to the capacity of the human body to survive various crash types above certain speeds of impact. It places a priority on systematically addressing major factors involved in specific crash types to achieve substantial road trauma reduction benefits over time. The safe system approach aims to minimise the severity of injury and is based on the premise that road users should not die because of system failings. It is derived from the work of the Swedish Road Authority and Road Safety Agencies in the Netherlands and has been adopted as the basis for road safety activity in Victoria, Australia since 2003. It is also adopted across Australia in the current National Road Safety Action Plan. This paper will review the components of the Safe System Approach and the progress made in Europe and Australia.

TI  - Assessing and managing older drivers’ crash risk using Safe System principles
SN  - 0734525516
PY  - 2006/10
SP  - 10p
AB  - The last decade has seen a large amount of road safety effort put into investigating the so-called ‘older driver problem’.  As a consequence, our knowledge of older drivers and their functional performance, their driving and crash patterns and their crash risk, has increased substantially.  However the research has given little direct attention to the special challenges that older drivers pose to a Safe System approach to road safety.  During this same decade, Australasian jurisdictions have increasingly accepted a Safe System approach to managing road safety.  This paper aims to evaluate the latest research findings: 1. to assess the extent and nature of older drivers’ crash risk in both absolute and relative terms; 2. to identify the array of effective countermeasures compatible with Safe System principles.  Topics covered include: physical frailty, the low mileage bias, fitness to drive, self-regulation, safer roads, safer cars and safer road users.

This paper aims to evaluate the latest research findings: 1. to assess the extent and nature of older drivers' crash risk in both absolute and relative terms; 2. to identify the array of effective countermeasures compatible with Safe System principles.  Topics covered include: physical frailty, the low mileage bias, fitness to drive, self-regulation, safer roads, safer cars and safer road users.

AB  - The 2004 "World Report on Road Traffic Injury Prevention" by the WHO and the World Bank provides a benchmark in our understanding of the global perspective of this problem and identifies the key road injury 'risk factors'.  The report also recommends practical actions to mitigate these factors and an integrated 'safety systems approach' to road safety improvements, using a lead agency to coordinate the development of road safety strategies and plans.

TI  - Setting speed limits for a safe system
PY  - 2006/09
SP  - 11P
AB  - Speed limits in Australia, typically based on engineering principles, are much higher than those internationally.  A safe system approach aimed at further reducing the level of road trauma in Australasia calls for greater attention to safety when specifying acceptable travel speeds on our roads.  Austroads recently commissioned a study aimed at establishing a balance between harm minimisation and mobility when setting speed limits to help achieve a safer transportation system.  This paper reports on developments to date and future initiatives to achieve this objective. (a) For the covering entry of this conference, please see ITRD abstract no. E214930.

TI  - Using the Safe System Approach to Keep Older Drivers Safely Mobile
PY  - 2006
VL  - 30

SP  - pp 97-109
AB  - This article discusses an Australian road safety system, as derived from similar systems in Sweden and the Netherlands, which analyzes roadway factors such as infrastructure, speed, and users in order to help to mitigate crashing and crash severity. The problems posed by certain factors related to older drivers are discussed in particular, such as fitness to drive, atypical driving patterns, and their greater physical frailty. The article presents four areas of improvement from the Australian program: design improvements for urban intersections, improved crashworthiness of vehicles, speed modifications, and improving the safety of road users themselves through better assessment procedures as well as better education for those drivers who require it. Education can take the form of health assessments, information regarding a person's crash risk, and driving adjustments.

AB  - All geographical regions are subject to devastation and disruption from natural disasters.  Optimizing safety requires understanding the natural and social systems involved in disasters, communicating clearly with decision makers that affect those systems, and identifying potentially effective interventions for consideration.  The application of system dynamics modeling, a metatheoretical and methodological approach of systems theory, helps to accomplish all three.  After a brief reference to systems' current place in hazards research and practice, the usefulness and types of systems models, including causal loop diagrams and stock and flow diagrams, are discussed. The methodological specification of system dynamics modeling is explained, along with the general modeling process.  Conclusions are advanced with a discussion of the application of system dynamics modeling in hazards work and its place in designing safe systems.

AB  - The essential road safety questions and challenges, central to achieving success in delivering road trauma reductions, as set out in ‘arrive alive!’ Victoria’s Road Safety Strategy 2002-2007, remain.  VicRoads and the other Victorian road safety agencies adopted the ‘safe system’ approach as a basis for reducing road trauma in late 2003.  It has been adopted by Austroads (2004) as a framework to guide road safety research programs and is a  prominent guiding principle in the draft National Road Safety Action Plan, 2005-2006, for the integrated development and implementation of Road Safety Policy.  The ‘systematic/systemwide’ approach is based on Swedish practice and experience, but in its application locally reflects the nature of the Victorian road transport system, its risks and characteristics.  It provides a framework for identifying and analysing the interactions between elements of the road transport system including its use, and the associated crash and crash outcome risks.

TI  - Towards Zero: building a safe road system for Victoria
PY  - 2015/10
SP  - 12p
AB  - During an average week in Victoria, five people are killed and a further 100 people are hospitalised following road crashes. There are far too many deaths and injuries and the ripple effect of road trauma is enormous. The Transport Accident Commission (TAC) no longer accepts deaths and serious injuries as being inevitable consequences of having a road network. The TAC’s vision is for a future where no one will be killed or seriously injured and where every journey is a safe journey. In order to realise the vision, the TAC must bring to life and implement initiatives which are guided by the principles which underpin the Towards Zero approach. This paper will detail the TAC’s strategy of initiatives being used to help Victoria move Towards Zero.

AB  - From the introduction process of Sustainable Safety specific lessons have  been learned to be at least supportive or were even a prerequisite, for successful action.  Intelligent ways to commit stakeholders have to be found a major one.  Sustainable Safety forms an integral part of Dutch transport and traffic policies.  Plans are in preparation to come to a new Road Safety Agreement in 2005.  In this framework the authors shall renew and update the vision using the working document title 'Sustainable safety version 2.0'.
