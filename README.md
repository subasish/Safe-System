# Safe Systems

The 2022 National Roadway Safety Strategy describes the major actions to be taken to make a meaningful difference over the next few years. At the core of this strategy is a Department-wide adoption of the Safe System Approach, which focuses on five key objectives: safer people, safer roads, safer vehicles, safer speeds, and post-crash care. We will launch new programs, coordinate and improve existing programs, and adopt a foundational set of principles to guide this strategy.

A curated list on Safe Systems will be helpful for the researchers.
